What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

D. Leader who expects the best gets high achievement
Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

After walking for three hours, Pedro said, “I am so tired 1.) _____ we sit for a few minutes? My feet are badly hurting, and I am so hungry.” Juan answered, “Of course, Pedro we 2.) _____.” But we 3.)_____ stay longer than ten minutes. It’s almost noon, and we 4.)_____ find our way back before sunset.” “Yes,” answered Jose. “Remember, we 5.)_____ stay here after sunset. I have heard that there are strange creatures coming out at night in this forest.” “Really?” Answered Pedro. “If that is the case, we 6.)_____ go back before four o’clock. By five o’clock we 7.)_____ be in the place where we started, or else we 8.)_____ lose our waySo, the three decided to rest and eat their lunch. After a few minutes, the three started walking. “What’s that?” shouted Juan. “Is that a cave? Pedro looked at Jose and said, “Are you sure there is a cave in this forest?” Jose answered, “I have never heard of it. My grandfather never mentioned a cave in his stories.” But Juan responded, “It definitely is! Look, there’s the entrance. It’s covered by vines, leaves and “cadena de amor”. Surely no one has discovered it before.” Jose nodded his head in disbelief. But he said, “Let’s check our map, and find out if it does exist.” As he looked at the map, he found many marks, but not one indicated a cave. “No, there isn’t any cave found in the map.” “There is a lake, but no cave.” He folded the crumpled map and said, “I believe we 8.)_____ go back. There is something strange happening here.” As he started to walk, Juan answered. “Ooh! Where’s your sense of adventure Jose, I guess the cave was never discovered before. Why don’t we go inside and explore this unknown cave?” he added. Pedro nodded in agreement. “Why not? We 10.)_____ discover treasures. We will be rich, if that happens.” The two excitedly cleared the vines and leaves covering the entrance of the cave and walked inside, while Jose reluctantly followed them.The next day, a search party was called by the families of the three men. The teams searched the forest, but Jose, Pedro and Juan were never found. “We looked everywhere.” The rescuers told the families of the three, we e ven reached the lake, but we could not find them.” Not one among the members of the search party of forest rescuers mentioned about the existence of a cave.-The End.​</a>

Esplanada - @inquirerdotnetPhilippine Daily Inquirer / 03:42 AM August 20, 2015HAPPY 137TH, MLQ President Aquino gently leads Zenaida Quezon Avanceña, President Manuel L. Quezon’s daughter, into the Quezon museum on Elliptical Road, Quezon City. The “Museo ni Manuel L. Quezon” at Quezon Memorial Shrine was inaugurated Wednesday in time for the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, the president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 1935 to 1944. PHOTO BY AURO MONTELLANO JR. AND GIL NARTEA/MALACAÑANG PHOTO BUREAUBetter late than never.The late President Manuel L. Quezon has been finally recognized for his “open door” policy during the Commonwealth period, which allowed the entry into the country of more than 1,300 Jewish refugees fleeing the horrors of Nazism under then German leader Adolf Hitler.During simple rites at Quezon Memorial Circle, the Philippine leader was awarded Wednesday the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation (RWF) Medal for his “life-saving plan” and for “reaching out to the victims of the Nazi murderous machine.”Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who saved an undisclosed number of Jews and persecuted people in Hungary during the Holocaust. His death while under Soviet captivity has been the subject of controversy.Internet connection problem cuts off Palace briefing on telco servicesThe medal was handed to Ma. Zenaida “Nini” Quezon Avanceña, daughter of Quezon, by Effie Ben-Matityau, Israel’s ambassador to the Philippines, and Lee Blumenthal, board member of the Jewish Association of the Philippines.President Aquino and other government officials attended the ceremony at the newly renovated Quezon Museum, which was formerly the Quezon ancestral home in New Manila, Quezon City. It was transported piece by piece to Quezon Memorial Circle.Monumental projectIn a statement, the RWF said Quezon’s “original life-saving plans were more ambitious and far reaching.”“In fact, he wanted to absorb some 100,000 Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe. However, his monumental project was thwarted by the outbreak of World War II and the Japanese invasion of the Philippines.”The group, which has offices in Jerusalem, Buenos Aires and New York, cited Quezon for epitomizing the “spirit of civic courage and solidarity exemplified by Raoul Wallenberg and all the men and women who reached out to the Nazi victims.”The RWF noted that “more than 300 heads of state, Nobel Prize laureates and distinguished personalities from all walks of life are honorary members of the foundation.”“One of the first to join its ranks was the then Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Mario Bergoglio, better known today as Pope Francis,” it added.The RWF event coincided with the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, described by Malacañang as “one of the many Filipinos who not only dedicated their careers to service but also led a life worthy of example.”“His accomplishments as a statesman include the ratification of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which led to Philippine self-government and eventual independence from the United States. Also among his legacies are his advocacy of women’s suffrage and the institutionalization of Filipino as our national language,” the Palace said.It added that Quezon’s “beliefs on the importance of moral and civic virtue are encapsulated in his Code of Citizenship and Ethics.”​</a>

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees.

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

After walking for three hours, Pedro said, “I am so tired 1.) _____ we sit for a few minutes? My feet are badly hurting, and I am so hungry.” Juan answered, “Of course, Pedro we 2.) _____.” But we 3.)_____ stay longer than ten minutes. It’s almost noon, and we 4.)_____ find our way back before sunset.” “Yes,” answered Jose. “Remember, we 5.)_____ stay here after sunset. I have heard that there are strange creatures coming out at night in this forest.” “Really?” Answered Pedro. “If that is the case, we 6.)_____ go back before four o’clock. By five o’clock we 7.)_____ be in the place where we started, or else we 8.)_____ lose our waySo, the three decided to rest and eat their lunch. After a few minutes, the three started walking. “What’s that?” shouted Juan. “Is that a cave? Pedro looked at Jose and said, “Are you sure there is a cave in this forest?” Jose answered, “I have never heard of it. My grandfather never mentioned a cave in his stories.” But Juan responded, “It definitely is! Look, there’s the entrance. It’s covered by vines, leaves and “cadena de amor”. Surely no one has discovered it before.” Jose nodded his head in disbelief. But he said, “Let’s check our map, and find out if it does exist.” As he looked at the map, he found many marks, but not one indicated a cave. “No, there isn’t any cave found in the map.” “There is a lake, but no cave.” He folded the crumpled map and said, “I believe we 8.)_____ go back. There is something strange happening here.” As he started to walk, Juan answered. “Ooh! Where’s your sense of adventure Jose, I guess the cave was never discovered before. Why don’t we go inside and explore this unknown cave?” he added. Pedro nodded in agreement. “Why not? We 10.)_____ discover treasures. We will be rich, if that happens.” The two excitedly cleared the vines and leaves covering the entrance of the cave and walked inside, while Jose reluctantly followed them.The next day, a search party was called by the families of the three men. The teams searched the forest, but Jose, Pedro and Juan were never found. “We looked everywhere.” The rescuers told the families of the three, we e ven reached the lake, but we could not find them.” Not one among the members of the search party of forest rescuers mentioned about the existence of a cave.-The End.​</h2><br />

Esplanada - @inquirerdotnetPhilippine Daily Inquirer / 03:42 AM August 20, 2015HAPPY 137TH, MLQ President Aquino gently leads Zenaida Quezon Avanceña, President Manuel L. Quezon’s daughter, into the Quezon museum on Elliptical Road, Quezon City. The “Museo ni Manuel L. Quezon” at Quezon Memorial Shrine was inaugurated Wednesday in time for the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, the president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 1935 to 1944. PHOTO BY AURO MONTELLANO JR. AND GIL NARTEA/MALACAÑANG PHOTO BUREAUBetter late than never.The late President Manuel L. Quezon has been finally recognized for his “open door” policy during the Commonwealth period, which allowed the entry into the country of more than 1,300 Jewish refugees fleeing the horrors of Nazism under then German leader Adolf Hitler.During simple rites at Quezon Memorial Circle, the Philippine leader was awarded Wednesday the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation (RWF) Medal for his “life-saving plan” and for “reaching out to the victims of the Nazi murderous machine.”Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who saved an undisclosed number of Jews and persecuted people in Hungary during the Holocaust. His death while under Soviet captivity has been the subject of controversy.Internet connection problem cuts off Palace briefing on telco servicesThe medal was handed to Ma. Zenaida “Nini” Quezon Avanceña, daughter of Quezon, by Effie Ben-Matityau, Israel’s ambassador to the Philippines, and Lee Blumenthal, board member of the Jewish Association of the Philippines.President Aquino and other government officials attended the ceremony at the newly renovated Quezon Museum, which was formerly the Quezon ancestral home in New Manila, Quezon City. It was transported piece by piece to Quezon Memorial Circle.Monumental projectIn a statement, the RWF said Quezon’s “original life-saving plans were more ambitious and far reaching.”“In fact, he wanted to absorb some 100,000 Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe. However, his monumental project was thwarted by the outbreak of World War II and the Japanese invasion of the Philippines.”The group, which has offices in Jerusalem, Buenos Aires and New York, cited Quezon for epitomizing the “spirit of civic courage and solidarity exemplified by Raoul Wallenberg and all the men and women who reached out to the Nazi victims.”The RWF noted that “more than 300 heads of state, Nobel Prize laureates and distinguished personalities from all walks of life are honorary members of the foundation.”“One of the first to join its ranks was the then Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Mario Bergoglio, better known today as Pope Francis,” it added.The RWF event coincided with the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, described by Malacañang as “one of the many Filipinos who not only dedicated their careers to service but also led a life worthy of example.”“His accomplishments as a statesman include the ratification of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which led to Philippine self-government and eventual independence from the United States. Also among his legacies are his advocacy of women’s suffrage and the institutionalization of Filipino as our national language,” the Palace said.It added that Quezon’s “beliefs on the importance of moral and civic virtue are encapsulated in his Code of Citizenship and Ethics.”​</h2><br />
