Multi-mode fiber optic cable has a large diametral core that allows modes of light to propagate. Because of this, the number of light reflections created as the light passes through the core increases, creating the ability for more data to pass through a given time. Because of high dispersion and attenuation rate with this fiber, the quality of signal is enlarged over long distances. 2. Single mode fiber optic cable has a big diametral core that allows only one mode of light to propagate. Because of this, the number of light reflections created as the light passes through the core decreases, lowering attenuation and creating the ability for the signal to travel further. This application is typically used in long distance. 3. Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) is the cable that has 2 or 4 pairs of wires. It is the most used cabling in networks. 4. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) each pair of wire is wrapped in metallic foil to better shield the wires from noise. Four (4) pairs of wires are then wrapped in an overall metallic braid or foil. 5.

(5 points each)Fashion (1) Fashion is said to have a language that can be read like a text. It serves as an explanation of people's character, personality, lifestyle and values. It works by using signs and codes which are recognizable to others and transmit messages. These signs, codes and messages are called semiotics and influence all aspects of our daily lives. Semiotics in fashion works to convey our identity and in this way, messages can be projected to the outside world. (2) The earliest types of clothing were body painting and adornments. According to experts it is generally believed that the aim of these alterations was to modify the body in some way in order to communicate a specific message. In modern times the aim is largely the same, although the messages are more varied, complex and wide ranging. Nowadays it is common for people to use clothing, color, fabric, jewelry, hairstyles and even tattoos. Dr. Walker from The Centre for Fashion Studies asserts that how we style our bodies is one of the most important factors in defining the self. (3) Fashion is not only used to define the self but also is a powerful tool for group identity. This can be most clearly seen in youth fashion which is often given a name to help convey the messages of its members. Fashion styles such as goth, mod and emo have semiotic signs and symbols which can represent values, beliefs and political ideologies. Often these values and ideas bring young people together who use clothing as a way to identify others who share their philosophy of life. (4) On the other hand, the semiotics of fashion can be seen as a product of a consumerbased society where appearance, especially through clothing, is valued and judged. This leads to people making conclusions about others on the basis of what they wear. These conclusions are often incorrect and damaging as they attach values and characteristics to people which they may not actually believe in or possess. (5) In conclusion fashion can be a useful way to analyze an individual, group, society or time period. Clothing and body adornment can highlight status, mood, ideas and values. Although semiotics has sometimes been criticized as a tool of judgment for appearance, it has generally offered a valuable insight into human thought and behavior throughout historyplsss po pasagot need ko lang po ​</a>

(1)Throughout most of my school days my eyes failed to focus correctly when reading, (2) Consequently, I saw different symbols every time I read a sentence. (3)As a result, the printed page was a chaotic kaleidoscope of constantly changing letters that made no sense. (4) For example, when reading the last sentence I would see: "A tters made sense,” or “As le ter that made no ense,” or“ Letters mad no sens," depending on how my eyes focused on a sentence. (5) After my eye problem was corrected, my real problems began because it was assumed that I could now read like everyone else.

The geologic time scale is used as a measure of the relative or absoluteduration or age of any part of geologic time.3. The geologic time is usually presented in the form of a chart showing the namesof the various rock-stratigraphic, time-stratigraphic, or geologic-time units.4. The table of geologic time spans agrees primarily with the nomenclature, dalesand standard color codes as set forth by the International Commission onStratification.5. Relative dating is an important tool used to portray the history of the Earth.6. Absolute dating provides the exact age of our planet.7. Igneous rocks are the best types of rock samples to use for radiometric dating8. The geologic time scale is divided into eons, eras, and periods9. The Earth is very new, and the study of Earth's past requires us to think abouttimes that were millions or even billions of years ago.10. The age of the Earth is 13.8 billion years.11. Scientists use the geologic time to illustrate the order in which events on Earthhave happened.12. The Earth's entire history is separated into four principal divisions namelyHadeon, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic.13. The generally accepted divisions of the geologic time from the smallest to themost encompassing are eon, era, period, epoch, age.14. Humans appeared during the quarternary period.15.

                                            TRUE or FALSE1. The Geologic Time Scale (GTS) is an arbitrary chronological arrangement orsequence of geologic events2. The geologic time scale is used as a measure of the relative or absoluteduration or age of any part of geologic time.3. The geologic time is usually presented in the form of a chart showing the namesof the various rock-stratigraphic, time-stratigraphic, or geologic-time units.4. The table of geologic time spans agrees primarily with the nomenclature, dalesand standard color codes as set forth by the International Commission onStratification.5. Relative dating is an important tool used to portray the history of the Earth.6. Absolute dating provides the exact age of our planet.7. Igneous rocks are the best types of rock samples to use for radiometric dating8. The geologic time scale is divided into eons, eras, and periods9. The Earth is very new, and the study of Earth's past requires us to think abouttimes that were millions or even billions of years ago.10. The age of the Earth is 13.8 billion years.11. Scientists use the geologic time to illustrate the order in which events on Earthhave happened.12. The Earth's entire history is separated into four principal divisions namelyHadeon, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic.13. The generally accepted divisions of the geologic time from the smallest to themost encompassing are eon, era, period, epoch, age.14. Humans appeared during the quarternary period.15. Geologist make use of information derived from marker fossils to define andidentify subdivisions of geologic time scale.​</a>

Multi-mode fiber optic cable has a large diametral core that allows modes of light to propagate. Because of this, the number of light reflections created as the light passes through the core increases, creating the ability for more data to pass through a given time. Because of high dispersion and attenuation rate with this fiber, the quality of signal is enlarged over long distances. 2. Single mode fiber optic cable has a big diametral core that allows only one mode of light to propagate. Because of this, the number of light reflections created as the light passes through the core decreases, lowering attenuation and creating the ability for the signal to travel further. This application is typically used in long distance. 3. Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) is the cable that has 2 or 4 pairs of wires. It is the most used cabling in networks. 4. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) each pair of wire is wrapped in metallic foil to better shield the wires from noise. Four (4) pairs of wires are then wrapped in an overall metallic braid or foil. 5.

                            13. Direction: Read the text below and identify the major topic of each paragraph. Choose from the choices provided after the reading text. (5 points each)Fashion (1) Fashion is said to have a language that can be read like a text. It serves as an explanation of people's character, personality, lifestyle and values. It works by using signs and codes which are recognizable to others and transmit messages. These signs, codes and messages are called semiotics and influence all aspects of our daily lives. Semiotics in fashion works to convey our identity and in this way, messages can be projected to the outside world. (2) The earliest types of clothing were body painting and adornments. According to experts it is generally believed that the aim of these alterations was to modify the body in some way in order to communicate a specific message. In modern times the aim is largely the same, although the messages are more varied, complex and wide ranging. Nowadays it is common for people to use clothing, color, fabric, jewelry, hairstyles and even tattoos. Dr. Walker from The Centre for Fashion Studies asserts that how we style our bodies is one of the most important factors in defining the self. (3) Fashion is not only used to define the self but also is a powerful tool for group identity. This can be most clearly seen in youth fashion which is often given a name to help convey the messages of its members. Fashion styles such as goth, mod and emo have semiotic signs and symbols which can represent values, beliefs and political ideologies. Often these values and ideas bring young people together who use clothing as a way to identify others who share their philosophy of life. (4) On the other hand, the semiotics of fashion can be seen as a product of a consumerbased society where appearance, especially through clothing, is valued and judged. This leads to people making conclusions about others on the basis of what they wear. These conclusions are often incorrect and damaging as they attach values and characteristics to people which they may not actually believe in or possess. (5) In conclusion fashion can be a useful way to analyze an individual, group, society or time period. Clothing and body adornment can highlight status, mood, ideas and values. Although semiotics has sometimes been criticized as a tool of judgment for appearance, it has generally offered a valuable insight into human thought and behavior throughout historyplsss po pasagot need ko lang po ​</h2><br />

Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 1. Evolution as defined by Darwin is a "descent with modification," the idea that species change over time. 2. Evolution is an artificial selection which the mechanism. 3. The term used for similar characteristics shared by organisms is called hematology. 4. The DNA codes and similar proteins of various organisms showed striking similarities. 5. The continental drift theory developed by Darwin Wegener states that the movement of plate tectonics shifted different continents, isolating certain landmasses. 6. All continents form from pieces of one giant supercontinent called Pangaea.  7. Darwin also proposed a mechanism for evolution: natural selection. 8. More offspring are produced than can survive. In living organisms, many characteristics are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring. 9. Offspring vary in their heritable traits. The offspring in any generation will be slightly different from one another in their traits (color, size, shape, etc.) 10. Traits are often heritable. Organisms are capable of producing more offspring than their environments can support.​</h2><br />

                            28. TRUE or FALSE1. The Geologic Time Scale (GTS) is an arbitrary chronological arrangement orsequence of geologic events2. The geologic time scale is used as a measure of the relative or absoluteduration or age of any part of geologic time.3. The geologic time is usually presented in the form of a chart showing the namesof the various rock-stratigraphic, time-stratigraphic, or geologic-time units.4. The table of geologic time spans agrees primarily with the nomenclature, dalesand standard color codes as set forth by the International Commission onStratification.5. Relative dating is an important tool used to portray the history of the Earth.6. Absolute dating provides the exact age of our planet.7. Igneous rocks are the best types of rock samples to use for radiometric dating8. The geologic time scale is divided into eons, eras, and periods9. The Earth is very new, and the study of Earth's past requires us to think abouttimes that were millions or even billions of years ago.10. The age of the Earth is 13.8 billion years.11. Scientists use the geologic time to illustrate the order in which events on Earthhave happened.12. The Earth's entire history is separated into four principal divisions namelyHadeon, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic.13. The generally accepted divisions of the geologic time from the smallest to themost encompassing are eon, era, period, epoch, age.14. Humans appeared during the quarternary period.15.
