Maynila - "Mas maraming pag-ulan. kumpara kay Ondoy"
Ganito inilarawan ng weather bureau PAGASA ang tindi ng ulang ibinuhos ng bagyong
Ulysses nang manalasa ito sa Metro Manila at ilang bahagi ng Luzon buong gabi ng Miyerkules
hanggang umaga ng Huwebes. "In terms of pag-ulan natin, ina-assess pa rin natin pero masasabi
nating mas maraming pag-ulan na naranasan dito sa bagyong Ulysses compared kay Ondoy dahil
malawak ang bagyo," ani weather forecaster Benison Estareja sa ABS-CBN TeleRadyo nitong
Huwebes. Ang tropical storm Ondoy ay naghasik ng lagim sa Marikina at ilang bahagi ng Metro
Manila at Rizal noong 2009. Nag-iwan ito ng higit 400 patay sa mga lugar na naapektuhan nito.
Nitong Huwebes, hindi maiwasan ng maraming residente sa Marikina na maalala ang Ondoy, lalo't
lubog muli sa baha ang maraming bahagi ng lungsod. Ang marami sa kanila, nagpapa-rescue na
dahil sa bubong na na-stranded nang unti-unting umangat ang tubig-baha. "Kulang na kulang at
marami tayong kababayan na takot na takot ngayon. Yung iba may hypothermia na dahil magdamag
nabasa, nahanginan," sabi ni Marikina Mayor Marcelino Teodoro sa TeleRadyo. Bukod sa Marikina,
nagbaha rin sa ilang bahagi ng Rizal, Pasig, Bulacan, Pampanga, at ilan pang lalawigan ng Luzon
Nanalanta si Ulysses mahigit isang linggo matapos mamerwisyo, partikular na sa Bicol region, si
super typhoon Rolly, ang pinakamalakas na bagyo sa mundo ngayong 2020. Nauna nang sinabi ng
pamahalaan na napaghandaan nila ang Ulysses. Paparating na rin daw ang rescue teams sa mga
lugar na lubog sa baha.

Maynila - "Mas maraming pag-ulan. kumpara kay Ondoy"
Ganito inilarawan ng weather bureau PAGASA ang tindi ng ulang ibinuhos ng bagyong
Ulysses nang manalasa ito sa Metro Manila at ilang bahagi ng Luzon buong gabi ng Miyerkules
hanggang umaga ng Huwebes. "In terms of pag-ulan natin, ina-assess pa rin natin pero masasabi
nating mas maraming pag-ulan na naranasan dito sa bagyong Ulysses compared kay Ondoy dahil
malawak ang bagyo," ani weather forecaster Benison Estareja sa ABS-CBN TeleRadyo nitong
Huwebes. Ang tropical storm Ondoy ay naghasik ng lagim sa Marikina at ilang bahagi ng Metro
Manila at Rizal noong 2009. Nag-iwan ito ng higit 400 patay sa mga lugar na naapektuhan nito.
Nitong Huwebes, hindi maiwasan ng maraming residente sa Marikina na maalala ang Ondoy, lalo't
lubog muli sa baha ang maraming bahagi ng lungsod. Ang marami sa kanila, nagpapa-rescue na
dahil sa bubong na na-stranded nang unti-unting umangat ang tubig-baha. "Kulang na kulang at
marami tayong kababayan na takot na takot ngayon. Yung iba may hypothermia na dahil magdamag
nabasa, nahanginan," sabi ni Marikina Mayor Marcelino Teodoro sa TeleRadyo. Bukod sa Marikina,
nagbaha rin sa ilang bahagi ng Rizal, Pasig, Bulacan, Pampanga, at ilan pang lalawigan ng Luzon
Nanalanta si Ulysses mahigit isang linggo matapos mamerwisyo, partikular na sa Bicol region, si
super typhoon Rolly, ang pinakamalakas na bagyo sa mundo ngayong 2020. Nauna nang sinabi ng
pamahalaan na napaghandaan nila ang Ulysses. Paparating na rin daw ang rescue teams sa mga
lugar na lubog sa baha.

Playing "Tumbang Preso" or "Tumba Lata" is one of my most favorite childhood games of all time because it is so fun and exciting to play. 5. Reaction:__________​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. <strong>REACTION </strong>-It is wonderful to hear that the person expressing this sentiment feels a strong connection to their Filipino heritage and culture. The "Bahay Kubo" is a traditional Filipino house that is often associated with the country's rural areas, and it is great to see that it continues to evoke positive emotions and memories among Filipinos. It is important to acknowledge and appreciate one's cultural roots and history, and it seems like this person has a deep appreciation for their Filipino identity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2. The idea that certain foods or cultural practices should be exclusive to a particular group of people is not uncommon, and it often stems from a desire to preserve cultural identity and traditions. However, it's important to note that food, like other aspects of culture, can also be shared and enjoyed by people from different backgrounds.</p><p></p><p>While it's true that bibingka is a traditional Filipino rice cake and is deeply rooted in Filipino culture and cuisine, it doesn't mean that it should be off-limits to non-Filipinos. In fact, sharing food and cultural practices can promote cultural exchange and understanding, which can help foster greater appreciation and respect for different cultures.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to share bibingka with non-Filipinos is up to the individual or community, but it's worth considering the potential benefits of sharing cultural experiences and traditions with others.</p><p></p><p>3. Reading stories from different cultures can broaden our understanding of the world and enhance our empathy towards others. At the same time, it's also essential to appreciate and celebrate the stories that come from our own culture, as they provide insight into our history, values, and identity as a people. "Noli Me Tangere" is a significant piece of Philippine literature that sheds light on the country's colonial past and continues to inspire and educate readers up to this day.</p><p></p><p></p><p>4. Based on my knowledge, "Halo-halo" is a popular Filipino dessert that is made of shaved ice, evaporated milk, various sweet beans, fruits, and other toppings. It is a refreshing and satisfying treat that can help alleviate the feeling of heat during hot weather.</p><p></p><p>5.playing "Tumbang Preso" or "Tumba Lata" during our childhood. It is a popular game in the Philippines, and it involves throwing a slipper or a stone to knock down a can or a bottle, which can be challenging and fun at the same time. It's great to hear that we enjoyed playing this game and that it holds a special place in our heart.</p><br />

No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today arewhat matters most is how effective learning takes place.15 Spiders are small animals.
