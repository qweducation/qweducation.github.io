                                            Lola, the True Martriarch Retold by Elena C. Cutiongco AsAlex Tizon and his brother Arthur grew into their teens, they started to realize the abnormality of Lola's situation. This became a bone of contention between the siblings and their mother who became jealous of their closeness to Lola. Tizon, himself, left his family home at age 23 due to conflicts with his mother. When Lola turned 75,Tizon "inherited" her from his mother. He and his wife, Melissa, tried to make up for his family's abuse. He gave her $200 weekly salary and the assurance that she was totally free to do as she pleased. However, Lola proved unable to break her habit of servitude. Tizon also sponsored a trip home for Lola on her 83rd birthday to visit her family in the Philippines. Lola went back to his family after the trip. Her family was Alex and his siblings, his mother, his wife and his children. Hence, while indeed there was exploitation, Lola herself might not have regarded it as such. Lola passed away at the age of 86, and Tizon accompanied her ashes back to her hometown in Tarlac. By this time, only Lola's 98-year-old sister Gregoria, her niece, Ebia and their extended family were there.Tizon's story shocked many Filipinos. Many felt she was terribly abused because modern-day families do not believe that they "own" their katulong or kasambahay as the original Tizon family did.Three writers published their reactions on Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI). According to Pinoy Kasi columnist Michael Tan ( PDI, May 24, 2017), "Our present system of domestic helpers is governed by a law prescribing minimum wage, SSS, Pag-ibig and Philhealth coverage. But in practice, it still carries the vestiges of precolonial alipin and Spanish colonial hacienda serf or tenant system. In exchange for food, shelter, a minimal salary and benefits, some employers have a strong sense of entitlement. Helpers are expected to be at their beck and call 24/7!" He concludes his article with this appeal: "Beyond the minimum wage and food and shelter, we owe our helpers a way out and I think it is worth looking into how we might help them find options, a way out of poverty. One obvious place to start would be with their education or their children's education, giving better fighting chance for social mobility!" In contrast to the above perspective, Roots and Wings columnist Ms. Cathy Babao (PDI, May 212, 2017) takes a more personal view. She writes, "Through Alex's epic, he liberates his family from the bondage of their family secret-he shows what courage looks like-that it's never too late. It takes just one truth- teller, with an extraordinary gift of words to break the shackles and set other family members free. Eric Caruncho, PDI feature writer, interviewed Alex Tizon's widow by email and he reproduces Melissa's concluding statement in his article (PDI, May 28, 2017): "Alex's family never used "slave" to describe Lola. It wasn't until Alex started writing his drafts for the Atlantic that the word came up as a description of her role... "Also, when she finally moved in with Alex and me 12 years ago, she was already in her 70s. We didn't want her to work. We wanted her to relax, rest and retire. Our kids loved her and so did all of Alex's nieces and nephews, who also lived in our neighborhood. Everyone in our family came over to see her regularly. She was the true matriarch of the Tizon family!. 1. Is the author in the viewed material speaking for himself or using the voice or opinion of a particular person or group? 1.

                                            Lola, the True Martriarch Retold by Elena C. Cutiongco AsAlex Tizon and his brother Arthur grew into their teens, they started to realize the abnormality of Lola's situation. This became a bone of contention between the siblings and their mother who became jealous of their closeness to Lola. Tizon, himself, left his family home at age 23 due to conflicts with his mother. When Lola turned 75,Tizon "inherited" her from his mother. He and his wife, Melissa, tried to make up for his family's abuse. He gave her $200 weekly salary and the assurance that she was totally free to do as she pleased. However, Lola proved unable to break her habit of servitude. Tizon also sponsored a trip home for Lola on her 83rd birthday to visit her family in the Philippines. Lola went back to his family after the trip. Her family was Alex and his siblings, his mother, his wife and his children. Hence, while indeed there was exploitation, Lola herself might not have regarded it as such. Lola passed away at the age of 86, and Tizon accompanied her ashes back to her hometown in Tarlac. By this time, only Lola's 98-year-old sister Gregoria, her niece, Ebia and their extended family were there.Tizon's story shocked many Filipinos. Many felt she was terribly abused because modern-day families do not believe that they "own" their katulong or kasambahay as the original Tizon family did.Three writers published their reactions on Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI). According to Pinoy Kasi columnist Michael Tan ( PDI, May 24, 2017), "Our present system of domestic helpers is governed by a law prescribing minimum wage, SSS, Pag-ibig and Philhealth coverage. But in practice, it still carries the vestiges of precolonial alipin and Spanish colonial hacienda serf or tenant system. In exchange for food, shelter, a minimal salary and benefits, some employers have a strong sense of entitlement. Helpers are expected to be at their beck and call 24/7!" He concludes his article with this appeal: "Beyond the minimum wage and food and shelter, we owe our helpers a way out and I think it is worth looking into how we might help them find options, a way out of poverty. One obvious place to start would be with their education or their children's education, giving better fighting chance for social mobility!" In contrast to the above perspective, Roots and Wings columnist Ms. Cathy Babao (PDI, May 212, 2017) takes a more personal view. She writes, "Through Alex's epic, he liberates his family from the bondage of their family secret-he shows what courage looks like-that it's never too late. It takes just one truth- teller, with an extraordinary gift of words to break the shackles and set other family members free. Eric Caruncho, PDI feature writer, interviewed Alex Tizon's widow by email and he reproduces Melissa's concluding statement in his article (PDI, May 28, 2017): "Alex's family never used "slave" to describe Lola. It wasn't until Alex started writing his drafts for the Atlantic that the word came up as a description of her role... "Also, when she finally moved in with Alex and me 12 years ago, she was already in her 70s. We didn't want her to work. We wanted her to relax, rest and retire. Our kids loved her and so did all of Alex's nieces and nephews, who also lived in our neighborhood. Everyone in our family came over to see her regularly. She was the true matriarch of the Tizon family!. QUESTION1. Is the author in the viewed material speaking for himself or using the voice or opinion of a particular person or group?1.

</p><p>________________15. Helping the victims of Typhoon Odeth is a nice gesture. ​- <strong>Subjective</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The grammatical technique in which writers show how nouns or pronouns relate to other words in a sentence is through <strong>noun cases</strong>. The function of a noun within a sentence is referred to as its case. <strong>Subjective, objective,</strong> and <strong>possessive</strong> are the three noun cases. Each case refers to the function and placement of a noun in the sentence in relation to the other words.</p><p><strong></strong></p>Subjective<p>When nouns and pronouns assume the form of the sentence's subject or are employed as predicate nouns, they appear in the subjective (also known as the nominative) case. Predicate nouns are preceded by different forms of the verb "be," which re-identify the subject. </p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>"The woman is a waitress."
</p><p>
Here, the word "is" -- a "be" verb -- precedes the word "waitress," which renames "[t]he woman." That means the noun case is subjective.</p><p></p>Objective<p>When a noun or pronoun occurs as a direct or indirect object, the objective case is employed. In sentences, direct objects are more common. They come after transitive or action verbs, whereas indirect objects indicate the verb's action's object as well as the direct object's recipient. It's also appropriate when the noun is the subject of a preposition.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>"The girl jumped over the couch."
</p><p>
Here, the couch is the object of the preposition, making the noun case objective.</p><p></p>Possessive<p>The possessive case is used to express ownership of nouns and pronouns. The possessive apostrophe is placed to match the ownership indicated by the possessive noun case. While there are exceptions for spelling, the apostrophe comes before the "s" in a singular possessive, while the apostrophe comes after the "s" in plural possessives.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>"Carrie ate Tommy's pancakes."
</p><p>
Tommy is the owner of the pancakes, and so the case is possessive.</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><br />

                            5. Lola, the True Martriarch Retold by Elena C. Cutiongco AsAlex Tizon and his brother Arthur grew into their teens, they started to realize the abnormality of Lola's situation. This became a bone of contention between the siblings and their mother who became jealous of their closeness to Lola. Tizon, himself, left his family home at age 23 due to conflicts with his mother. When Lola turned 75,Tizon "inherited" her from his mother. He and his wife, Melissa, tried to make up for his family's abuse. He gave her $200 weekly salary and the assurance that she was totally free to do as she pleased. However, Lola proved unable to break her habit of servitude. Tizon also sponsored a trip home for Lola on her 83rd birthday to visit her family in the Philippines. Lola went back to his family after the trip. Her family was Alex and his siblings, his mother, his wife and his children. Hence, while indeed there was exploitation, Lola herself might not have regarded it as such. Lola passed away at the age of 86, and Tizon accompanied her ashes back to her hometown in Tarlac. By this time, only Lola's 98-year-old sister Gregoria, her niece, Ebia and their extended family were there.Tizon's story shocked many Filipinos. Many felt she was terribly abused because modern-day families do not believe that they "own" their katulong or kasambahay as the original Tizon family did.Three writers published their reactions on Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI). According to Pinoy Kasi columnist Michael Tan ( PDI, May 24, 2017), "Our present system of domestic helpers is governed by a law prescribing minimum wage, SSS, Pag-ibig and Philhealth coverage. But in practice, it still carries the vestiges of precolonial alipin and Spanish colonial hacienda serf or tenant system. In exchange for food, shelter, a minimal salary and benefits, some employers have a strong sense of entitlement. Helpers are expected to be at their beck and call 24/7!" He concludes his article with this appeal: "Beyond the minimum wage and food and shelter, we owe our helpers a way out and I think it is worth looking into how we might help them find options, a way out of poverty. One obvious place to start would be with their education or their children's education, giving better fighting chance for social mobility!" In contrast to the above perspective, Roots and Wings columnist Ms. Cathy Babao (PDI, May 212, 2017) takes a more personal view. She writes, "Through Alex's epic, he liberates his family from the bondage of their family secret-he shows what courage looks like-that it's never too late. It takes just one truth- teller, with an extraordinary gift of words to break the shackles and set other family members free. Eric Caruncho, PDI feature writer, interviewed Alex Tizon's widow by email and he reproduces Melissa's concluding statement in his article (PDI, May 28, 2017): "Alex's family never used "slave" to describe Lola. It wasn't until Alex started writing his drafts for the Atlantic that the word came up as a description of her role... "Also, when she finally moved in with Alex and me 12 years ago, she was already in her 70s. We didn't want her to work. We wanted her to relax, rest and retire. Our kids loved her and so did all of Alex's nieces and nephews, who also lived in our neighborhood. Everyone in our family came over to see her regularly. She was the true matriarch of the Tizon family!. 1. Is the author in the viewed material speaking for himself or using the voice or opinion of a particular person or group? 1.

                            10. Lola, the True Martriarch Retold by Elena C. Cutiongco AsAlex Tizon and his brother Arthur grew into their teens, they started to realize the abnormality of Lola's situation. This became a bone of contention between the siblings and their mother who became jealous of their closeness to Lola. Tizon, himself, left his family home at age 23 due to conflicts with his mother. When Lola turned 75,Tizon "inherited" her from his mother. He and his wife, Melissa, tried to make up for his family's abuse. He gave her $200 weekly salary and the assurance that she was totally free to do as she pleased. However, Lola proved unable to break her habit of servitude. Tizon also sponsored a trip home for Lola on her 83rd birthday to visit her family in the Philippines. Lola went back to his family after the trip. Her family was Alex and his siblings, his mother, his wife and his children. Hence, while indeed there was exploitation, Lola herself might not have regarded it as such. Lola passed away at the age of 86, and Tizon accompanied her ashes back to her hometown in Tarlac. By this time, only Lola's 98-year-old sister Gregoria, her niece, Ebia and their extended family were there.Tizon's story shocked many Filipinos. Many felt she was terribly abused because modern-day families do not believe that they "own" their katulong or kasambahay as the original Tizon family did.Three writers published their reactions on Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI). According to Pinoy Kasi columnist Michael Tan ( PDI, May 24, 2017), "Our present system of domestic helpers is governed by a law prescribing minimum wage, SSS, Pag-ibig and Philhealth coverage. But in practice, it still carries the vestiges of precolonial alipin and Spanish colonial hacienda serf or tenant system. In exchange for food, shelter, a minimal salary and benefits, some employers have a strong sense of entitlement. Helpers are expected to be at their beck and call 24/7!" He concludes his article with this appeal: "Beyond the minimum wage and food and shelter, we owe our helpers a way out and I think it is worth looking into how we might help them find options, a way out of poverty. One obvious place to start would be with their education or their children's education, giving better fighting chance for social mobility!" In contrast to the above perspective, Roots and Wings columnist Ms. Cathy Babao (PDI, May 212, 2017) takes a more personal view. She writes, "Through Alex's epic, he liberates his family from the bondage of their family secret-he shows what courage looks like-that it's never too late. It takes just one truth- teller, with an extraordinary gift of words to break the shackles and set other family members free. Eric Caruncho, PDI feature writer, interviewed Alex Tizon's widow by email and he reproduces Melissa's concluding statement in his article (PDI, May 28, 2017): "Alex's family never used "slave" to describe Lola. It wasn't until Alex started writing his drafts for the Atlantic that the word came up as a description of her role... "Also, when she finally moved in with Alex and me 12 years ago, she was already in her 70s. We didn't want her to work. We wanted her to relax, rest and retire. Our kids loved her and so did all of Alex's nieces and nephews, who also lived in our neighborhood. Everyone in our family came over to see her regularly. She was the true matriarch of the Tizon family!. QUESTION1. Is the author in the viewed material speaking for himself or using the voice or opinion of a particular person or group?1.
