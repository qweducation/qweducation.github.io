                                            Tsinelas,
By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.
Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of Reading
I have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.
He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.
It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.
I am this kid.

Then, answer the questions that follow. Do this in your notebook. "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines-Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law."

                                            Hero of the epic Biag ni Lam-Ang of the IlocanoLAM-ANG is the hero of one of the most popular Philippine folk epics, Biag ni Lam-ang (Life of Lam-Ang). The Biag ni Lam-ang, from the people of the northern Philippines, is said to be the only complete epic from a Christianized Philippine indigenous group. Exhibiting a mixture of Spanish and indigenous cultures, the earliest written record of the epic was in 1889. There are at least ten versions of the epic.SYNOPSIS OF BIAG NI LAM-ANGNamongan gives birth to a baby with incredible strength and courage, named Lam-ang. The boy asks his mother about his father’s whereabouts and learns that he has gone to fight the Igorot. Lam-ang arms himself with charms and decides to look for his father. From a dream, he learns that his father, Don Juan Panganiban, had been killed by the Igorot.Later, Lam-ang finds the Igorot in a sagang, a feast celebrating a successful headhunting expedition. His father’s head is dis-played in the feast. Lam-ang slays them all with his spear and mutilates the last among them.When Lam-ang returns home, 99 maidens wash his hair in the river. For his shampoo, he burns so many rice straw that the communities near the river are alarmed by the smoke. The dirt from his hair kills all the fishes in the river. He then kills a crocodile and carries it on his shoulder ashore amidst the applause of his companions.Lam-ang hears about a beautiful maiden named Ines Cannoyan, the daughter of the richest man in the town of Kalanutian. He tells his mother of his desire to court the maiden. Although his mother discourages him, he goes anyway, dressed in gold and accompanied by his pet rooster and white dog. The giant Sumarang blocks his way and belittles him. Lam-ang defeats him in a duel and hurls him nine hills away. Later, Sarindadan tries to seduce him but Lam-ang rejects her advances.Reaching Kalanutian, he impresses Ines with his magic. His rooster crows and topples a small outhouse. His dog barks and the outhouse is rebuilt. Ines invites him to the house where the rooster acts as Lam-ang’s spokesperson. Ines’ parents ask for a bride price, which Lam-ang agrees to give.Lam-ang returns home to prepare for the wedding and the presents. He and his townsfolk sail on two golden ships to Kalanutian where Lam-ang and Ines have a Catholic wedding. The townspeople board the two ships to Nalbuan, Lam-ang’s birthplace, to continue the celebration.After the celebration, Lam-ang agrees to hunt rarang, a shellfish. He is swallowed by a giant fish, called berkakang, as he has dreamt so. However, a diver recovers his bones. The pet rooster flaps its wings and resurrects Lam-ang. He then rewards the diver and lives happily with his wife and pets.— CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Philippine Literature, Volume 9 (Cultural Center of the Philippines, 1994)​</a>

My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare

could from his meager salary and from what he could

Do this in your notebook.MANUEL QUEZON "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines–Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at the San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.''1.

                                            By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree?

Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of Reading
I have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks.

Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.
He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship.

The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer.

It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.
I am this kid.

My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded.

                            11. Hero of the epic Biag ni Lam-Ang of the IlocanoLAM-ANG is the hero of one of the most popular Philippine folk epics, Biag ni Lam-ang (Life of Lam-Ang). The Biag ni Lam-ang, from the people of the northern Philippines, is said to be the only complete epic from a Christianized Philippine indigenous group. Exhibiting a mixture of Spanish and indigenous cultures, the earliest written record of the epic was in 1889. There are at least ten versions of the epic.SYNOPSIS OF BIAG NI LAM-ANGNamongan gives birth to a baby with incredible strength and courage, named Lam-ang. The boy asks his mother about his father’s whereabouts and learns that he has gone to fight the Igorot. Lam-ang arms himself with charms and decides to look for his father. From a dream, he learns that his father, Don Juan Panganiban, had been killed by the Igorot.Later, Lam-ang finds the Igorot in a sagang, a feast celebrating a successful headhunting expedition. His father’s head is dis-played in the feast. Lam-ang slays them all with his spear and mutilates the last among them.When Lam-ang returns home, 99 maidens wash his hair in the river. For his shampoo, he burns so many rice straw that the communities near the river are alarmed by the smoke. The dirt from his hair kills all the fishes in the river. He then kills a crocodile and carries it on his shoulder ashore amidst the applause of his companions.Lam-ang hears about a beautiful maiden named Ines Cannoyan, the daughter of the richest man in the town of Kalanutian. He tells his mother of his desire to court the maiden. Although his mother discourages him, he goes anyway, dressed in gold and accompanied by his pet rooster and white dog. The giant Sumarang blocks his way and belittles him. Lam-ang defeats him in a duel and hurls him nine hills away. Later, Sarindadan tries to seduce him but Lam-ang rejects her advances.Reaching Kalanutian, he impresses Ines with his magic. His rooster crows and topples a small outhouse. His dog barks and the outhouse is rebuilt. Ines invites him to the house where the rooster acts as Lam-ang’s spokesperson. Ines’ parents ask for a bride price, which Lam-ang agrees to give.Lam-ang returns home to prepare for the wedding and the presents. He and his townsfolk sail on two golden ships to Kalanutian where Lam-ang and Ines have a Catholic wedding. The townspeople board the two ships to Nalbuan, Lam-ang’s birthplace, to continue the celebration.After the celebration, Lam-ang agrees to hunt rarang, a shellfish. He is swallowed by a giant fish, called berkakang, as he has dreamt so. However, a diver recovers his bones. The pet rooster flaps its wings and resurrects Lam-ang. He then rewards the diver and lives happily with his wife and pets.— CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Philippine Literature, Volume 9 (Cultural Center of the Philippines, 1994)​</h2><br />

The story was handed down orally for generations before it was written down around 1640 assumedly by a blind I lokano bard named Pedro Bucaneg.BUOD (SUMMARY) OF BIAG NI LAM-ANGDon Juan and his wife Namongan lived in Nalbuan, now part of La Union in the northern part of the Philippines. They had a son named Lam-ang. Before Lam-ang was born, Don Juan went to the mountains in order to punish a group of their Igorot enemies. While he was away, his son Lam-ang was born. It took four people to help Namongan give birth. As soon as the baby boy popped out, he spoke and asked that he be given the name Lam-ang. He also chose his godparents and asked where his father was.After nine months of waiting for his father to return, Lam-ang decided he would go lookfor him. Namongan thought Lam-ang was up to the challenge but she was sad to lethim go. During his exhausting journey, he decided to rest for awhile. He fell asleep andhad a dream about his father's head being stuck on a pole by the Igorot. Lam-ang wasfurious when he learned what had happened to his father. He rushed to their village andkilled them all, except for one whom he let go so that he could tell other people aboutLam-ang's greatness.Upon returning to Nalbuan in triumph, he was bathed by women in the Amburayan river. All the fish died because of the dirt and odor from Lam-ang's body.There was a young woman named Ines Kannoyan whom Lam-ang wanted to woo. She lived in Calanutian and he brought along his white rooster and gray dog to visit her. On the way, Lam-ang met his enemy Sumarang, another suitor of Ines whom he fought and readily defeated.Lam-ang found the house of Ines surrounded by many suitors all of whom were trying to catch her attention. He had his rooster crow, which caused a nearby house to fall. This made Ines look out. He had his dog bark and in an instant the fallen house rose up again.

                            28. Learning Task 1: Read President Manuel L. Quezon's autobiography taken from his privilege speech delivered in 1933. Then, answer the questions that follow. Do this in your notebook.MANUEL QUEZON "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines–Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at the San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.''1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.  President Manuel L. Quezon <strong>can indeed inspired anyone to pursue his/her dreams no matter how difficult their situation could get</strong>.  Compared to his time, we have more opportunities to live a better, more fulfilled life since we live in a freer society.  Moreover, his example as public servant can also inspired people to pay it forward and do what they can to help others.</p><p>2.  For sure, <strong>he wants to inspire the youth of his time to dream big and do what they can to chase their dreams</strong>.  From a simple family that lives on a meager four-peso monthly income, he has come a long way to becoming a leader of the republic.  His fine example has outlived many generations  and continues to inspire people at this time. <strong>He also probably wants to encourage the people to help one another </strong>which is important in uplifting their lives.</p><p>3. It can make young people <strong>rethink how important it is that to value every opportunity that they are handed right now</strong>.  It may be in the form of education which not everyone gets to have.  They better start focusing on things that matter to to them as a student, and make sure they are doing their best.  </p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

                            30. By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</h2><br />
