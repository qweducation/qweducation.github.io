Analyze each situation. Explain your answer
In which case is the vehicle accelerating?
1. A car changing lane with constant speed
2. A jeepney speeding up in an effort to beat the red light
3. A motorcycle slowing down while making a left turn
4. A tricycle going around the circle at a constant speed
5. A bicycle moving along a straight track with constant speed</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>A car changing lane with constant speed: The car is not accelerating as its speed remains constant. It only changes its direction, which is not the same as acceleration.A jeepney speeding up in an effort to beat the red light: The jeepney is accelerating as its speed is changing, increasing from its initial speed to a higher speed.A motorcycle slowing down while making a left turn: The motorcycle is also accelerating, but in the negative direction as it is slowing down. Although the motorcycle is turning, the acceleration is in the direction of slowing down.A tricycle going around the circle at a constant speed: The tricycle is not accelerating, as its speed remains constant, and it moves in a circular path.A bicycle moving along a straight track with constant speed: The bicycle is not accelerating since its speed remains constant. It only moves in a straight line, which is not the same as acceleration.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. If the velocity of an object is changing, it means that it is accelerating. In the given situations, only the jeepney speeding up and the motorcycle slowing down are examples of acceleration.<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. In this case, the car is not accelerating since it is moving with a constant speed in a straight line.</p><p></p><p>2. The jeepney is accelerating since it is speeding up in an effort to beat the red light. Acceleration is defined as a change in velocity over time, and since the jeepney is changing its velocity by increasing its speed, it is undergoing acceleration.</p><p></p><p>3. The motorcycle is also accelerating in this case, but in the negative direction. As it slows down while making a left turn, its velocity is decreasing over time, resulting in negative acceleration.</p><p></p><p>4. The tricycle is not accelerating since it is moving at a constant speed around the circle. Although its direction is changing, its speed remains the same, so there is no acceleration.</p><p></p><p>5. The bicycle is also not accelerating since it is moving with a constant speed along a straight track. There is no change in velocity over time, so there is no acceleration.</p><br />
