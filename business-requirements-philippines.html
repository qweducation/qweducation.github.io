  3. During his trip to the main agency, he was advised to seek help from its attached agency that is responsible for marketing and promoting the Philippines as a major global tourism destination.
  This agency will teach him how to market and promote activities such as information dissemination, public relations, special events, related tourism programs and more...
  ...importantly how to market the Philippines as a major MICE destination.
  4. He plans to hire competent people who are knowledgeable, that is why he needs to go to this office or agency that develops training...
  ...modules and conduct multi skills training seminars, including continuing education programs for the industry manpower.
  5. One of the equipment that he will need is a vehicle. He has to secure a license and certificate to operate from an agency...

                                            Directions: Read the passage about Asian-African traditions and values. Synthesize it by 
accomplishing the graphic organizer below. FILIPINO CUSTOMSFaithfulness to the family is a tradition that is characteristic of Filipino society. This family loyalty is apparent in the fact that there are no booming businesses for retirement homes or orphanages in the Philippines.Also important to Filipinos is treating elders (even someone a year older is an "elder") with the respect and deference they deserve and require. There are many ways a person can show respect, whether it is by using hand gestures or speaking in a manner that denotes respect.As with many Asian countries, removal of shoes is customary when entering someone's home. By doing this the visitors shows his/her respect for the family and their home, as well as having basic courtesy.To recognize an elder's presence, a younger person may take the elder's hand (usually someone at least 15 years older), bring it to forehead and then release it.It is also customary for Filipinos to use a lot of hand and facial gestures to communicate. In their communication with each other, speaking politely is important as is speaking with a gentle tone of voice. Arguing is not acceptable, along with public criticism.Unlike other Asian countries where women tend to be in more subservient positions, women in the Philippines have had high societal positions since precolonial times. Since there is sexual equality, businesses are more accepting of women performing business. This attitude is apparent with the current Philippine preside. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is the second woman to hold this esteemed position. Corazon Aquino was the first female president and held the position from 1986-1992)TITLE:When I started reading, I thought ..._______________________________________As I was reading, I began thinking …_______________________________________Now that I have read, I think …_________________________________________​</a>

  ...importantly how to market the Philippines as a major MICE destination.

                            25. Directions: Read the passage about Asian-African traditions and values. Synthesize it by 
accomplishing the graphic organizer below. FILIPINO CUSTOMSFaithfulness to the family is a tradition that is characteristic of Filipino society. This family loyalty is apparent in the fact that there are no booming businesses for retirement homes or orphanages in the Philippines.Also important to Filipinos is treating elders (even someone a year older is an "elder") with the respect and deference they deserve and require. There are many ways a person can show respect, whether it is by using hand gestures or speaking in a manner that denotes respect.As with many Asian countries, removal of shoes is customary when entering someone's home. By doing this the visitors shows his/her respect for the family and their home, as well as having basic courtesy.To recognize an elder's presence, a younger person may take the elder's hand (usually someone at least 15 years older), bring it to forehead and then release it.It is also customary for Filipinos to use a lot of hand and facial gestures to communicate. In their communication with each other, speaking politely is important as is speaking with a gentle tone of voice. Arguing is not acceptable, along with public criticism.Unlike other Asian countries where women tend to be in more subservient positions, women in the Philippines have had high societal positions since precolonial times. Since there is sexual equality, businesses are more accepting of women performing business. This attitude is apparent with the current Philippine preside. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is the second woman to hold this esteemed position. Corazon Aquino was the first female president and held the position from 1986-1992)TITLE:When I started reading, I thought ..._______________________________________As I was reading, I began thinking …_______________________________________Now that I have read, I think …_________________________________________​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>In 1991, the Philippines passed a law requiring business to take back and recycle all forms of packaging. A large group of business formed a company to collect and recycle these packages. Its cost are 45 centavos per kilo for glass 9.5 centavos per kilo for paper and 74 centavo per kilo for plastic and the average recycling cost of about P100 per ton for glass and P200 per ton for plastic and the average recycling cost P500 per ton. A developing country has offered to create a giant landfill and accept the Philippines waste at a cost of P400 per ton, which includes P50 per ton sorting and transport cost and a P350 per ton fee to be paid to the developing country.</strong></p><p><strong>Questions:</strong></p><strong>Should the Philippines accept this proposal?</strong><strong>Will the proposal benefit the developing country?</strong><strong>What alternative or modification to the proposal might you suggest?</strong><p>In my opinion, I think the Philippines should accept this proposal because this is an opportunity for the Philippines to let go <strong>unsustainable packaging.</strong> In the second question, in the financial sense, the developing country might benefit from the proposal because of two things. First, they will have additional income. Second, if the developing country is able to recycle the materials that they have collected, it can become another form of resource and may be able to establish homegrown <strong>sustainable packaging companies.</strong> For the last question, I suggest that the contract remain intact in order to finally stop the<strong> worst packaging for the environment.</strong></p><br /><br /><br />
