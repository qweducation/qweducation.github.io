                                            The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</a>

                                            pahelp namn Po pagawan Ng plotA bright red explosion sends a big impact and damages in the surface towards the city of Mystique. The poor mother Bennett leaves her son Adam behind, because the ground is where Bennett stepping on is lifted onto the sky with the red light and vanished into thin air. Pave the way unto a new beginning        a beginning where the son of Bennett’s discoveries started finding his hometown; a beginning of a story where Adam and his friends will experience a journey with conflict and adventure.          The sun was shining very lightly, and the birds chirped along with the alarm clock. And I ‘am done preparing my bag ang books that I borrowed from my Uncle Jisei. While walking down the stoned road I hear my friend Cecilia repeatedly calling my name, “Hey Adam! I’m here” and run towards me and show me a book that says, ‘Red Rubies of Mystique Empire’ I at her with a confused face then she replied, “I found this book at your uncle’s bookshelf do you think it is something sentimental?” then I immediately took the book on her and read it. I open the pages of the book and there is a word that caught my attention, the word is, “The charisma of red rubies gives power to the people living in the city of Mystique, but there are only four humans have this. If you collect all the four red stones, you will have the power of immortality” as soon as I read the line the cold chill ran through my bones because in my pocket, I have one red ruby were this is the last thing my mom gave me after she vanished into thin air but the fact that the red rubies is true, I finally got the courage to discover myself more.          As the excitement gives me shivers, I look up to Cecilia and were both smiling as we make eye contact, Cecilia knows that I love exploring when it comes to searching new things when Mystique Empire is involved. And I start to think of ideas to find and search the lost Mystique Empire.      Now I started with a new plan to find this red rubies and search first the map of the empire, I ask Cecilia to come with me and visit Cooper to ask more about this book’s content. As we arrive at Cooper’s house, I saw him at the balcony and waved at us, I and Cecilia wave back. “Good morning! Adam and Cecilia, what is it today? But before that come in”, he spoke using his angel like voice that can instantly put someone to sleep.“Is something bothering you?”, he asked me with a hint of excitement in his eyes.“Not that I was bothered, I found something interesting check this out”, I spoke truthfully and handed the book to him.“Does it have anything to do with how you want to find out about this rubies, well I’m in, so what’s the plan Adam?” Cooper said while smirking. Cecilia chuckled and said, “Don’t forget about me I ‘amalso part of this expedition”.Cooper also reveals that he made a trade with my uncle Jisei, the deal is that Cooper will give the treasure chest to uncle for a Journal, a book describing the history and path to Mystique Empire.          After the whole planning we are finally ready to take off to a spaceship that we barrowed to uncle Jisei who agree to use it in one condition that bring his spaceship in good shaped. The expedition is headed by me the one and only Adam Holmes. “We are now ready to take off in the count of five, four, three, two, one, launched on!” after the countdown, I launched on the spaceship.“We are now going to you, my beloved Mystique!” As Cecilia shouted with joy.While the spaceship is on pilot mode we talk about what route and step will do in the Mystique Empire if we find it. “The path says we should go straight to the bright red stars along our way, can you speed up this spaceship a bit faster Cooper, and Cecilia check both sides of the ship if there is an asteroid laser them.”“Roger that!” both Cooper and Cecilia said.         And then while they are on their task, I check my ruby and play it in my hand, I remember my mother giving me this as a symbol of being a true blooded mystique, I didn’t know at first that this will give me a power that I can obtain, but for now I need to find the place where I came from and what was really happened to the empire.​</a>

                                            27-30. Give 4 benefits in planting trees or fruit-bearing trees​Social BenefitsTrees make life nicer. It has been shown that spending time among trees and green spaces reduces the amount of stress that we carry around with us in our daily lives.Hospital patients have been shown to recover from surgery more quickly when their hospital room offered a view of trees.Children have been shown to retain more of the information taught in schools if they spend some of their time outdoors in green spaces.Trees are often planted as living memorials or reminders of loved ones or to commemorate significant events in our lives.Communal BenefitsEven though you may own the trees on your property your neighbors may benefit from them as well.Through careful planning trees can be an asset to your entire community.Tree lined streets have a traffic calming effect, traffic moves more slowly and safely.Trees can be placed to screen unwanted views or noise from busy highways.Trees can complement the architecture or design of buildings or entire neighborhoods.Environmental BenefitsTrees offer many environmental benefits.Trees reduce the urban heat island effect through evaporative cooling and reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches parking lots and buildings. This is especially true in areas with large impervious surfaces, such as parking lots of stores and industrial complexes.Trees improve our air quality by filtering harmful dust and pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from the air we breathe.Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe.Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding.Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.Economic BenefitsWell placed trees can reduce your cooling costs in the summer by shading the south and west sides of your home. If deciduous trees are used they will allow the sun to pass through and warm your home in the winter.Evergreen trees on the north side of your home and shrubs around the foundation of your home can act as a windbreak to reduce the cooling effects of winter winds.The value of a well landscaped home with mature healthy trees can be as much as 10% higher than a similar home with no or little landscaping. (Topping will reduce the value of your trees)Some indirect economic benefits of trees are that if we reduce the energy we use then utility companies will have less demand placed on the infrastructure, thus reducing operating costs which can be passed on to the consumer.</a>

                            13. The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</h2><br />

                            14. pahelp namn Po pagawan Ng plotA bright red explosion sends a big impact and damages in the surface towards the city of Mystique. The poor mother Bennett leaves her son Adam behind, because the ground is where Bennett stepping on is lifted onto the sky with the red light and vanished into thin air. Pave the way unto a new beginning        a beginning where the son of Bennett’s discoveries started finding his hometown; a beginning of a story where Adam and his friends will experience a journey with conflict and adventure.          The sun was shining very lightly, and the birds chirped along with the alarm clock. And I ‘am done preparing my bag ang books that I borrowed from my Uncle Jisei. While walking down the stoned road I hear my friend Cecilia repeatedly calling my name, “Hey Adam! I’m here” and run towards me and show me a book that says, ‘Red Rubies of Mystique Empire’ I at her with a confused face then she replied, “I found this book at your uncle’s bookshelf do you think it is something sentimental?” then I immediately took the book on her and read it. I open the pages of the book and there is a word that caught my attention, the word is, “The charisma of red rubies gives power to the people living in the city of Mystique, but there are only four humans have this. If you collect all the four red stones, you will have the power of immortality” as soon as I read the line the cold chill ran through my bones because in my pocket, I have one red ruby were this is the last thing my mom gave me after she vanished into thin air but the fact that the red rubies is true, I finally got the courage to discover myself more.          As the excitement gives me shivers, I look up to Cecilia and were both smiling as we make eye contact, Cecilia knows that I love exploring when it comes to searching new things when Mystique Empire is involved. And I start to think of ideas to find and search the lost Mystique Empire.      Now I started with a new plan to find this red rubies and search first the map of the empire, I ask Cecilia to come with me and visit Cooper to ask more about this book’s content. As we arrive at Cooper’s house, I saw him at the balcony and waved at us, I and Cecilia wave back. “Good morning! Adam and Cecilia, what is it today? But before that come in”, he spoke using his angel like voice that can instantly put someone to sleep.“Is something bothering you?”, he asked me with a hint of excitement in his eyes.“Not that I was bothered, I found something interesting check this out”, I spoke truthfully and handed the book to him.“Does it have anything to do with how you want to find out about this rubies, well I’m in, so what’s the plan Adam?” Cooper said while smirking. Cecilia chuckled and said, “Don’t forget about me I ‘amalso part of this expedition”.Cooper also reveals that he made a trade with my uncle Jisei, the deal is that Cooper will give the treasure chest to uncle for a Journal, a book describing the history and path to Mystique Empire.          After the whole planning we are finally ready to take off to a spaceship that we barrowed to uncle Jisei who agree to use it in one condition that bring his spaceship in good shaped. The expedition is headed by me the one and only Adam Holmes. “We are now ready to take off in the count of five, four, three, two, one, launched on!” after the countdown, I launched on the spaceship.“We are now going to you, my beloved Mystique!” As Cecilia shouted with joy.While the spaceship is on pilot mode we talk about what route and step will do in the Mystique Empire if we find it. “The path says we should go straight to the bright red stars along our way, can you speed up this spaceship a bit faster Cooper, and Cecilia check both sides of the ship if there is an asteroid laser them.”“Roger that!” both Cooper and Cecilia said.         And then while they are on their task, I check my ruby and play it in my hand, I remember my mother giving me this as a symbol of being a true blooded mystique, I didn’t know at first that this will give me a power that I can obtain, but for now I need to find the place where I came from and what was really happened to the empire.​</h2><br />

                            23. 27-30. Give 4 benefits in planting trees or fruit-bearing trees​Social BenefitsTrees make life nicer. It has been shown that spending time among trees and green spaces reduces the amount of stress that we carry around with us in our daily lives.Hospital patients have been shown to recover from surgery more quickly when their hospital room offered a view of trees.Children have been shown to retain more of the information taught in schools if they spend some of their time outdoors in green spaces.Trees are often planted as living memorials or reminders of loved ones or to commemorate significant events in our lives.Communal BenefitsEven though you may own the trees on your property your neighbors may benefit from them as well.Through careful planning trees can be an asset to your entire community.Tree lined streets have a traffic calming effect, traffic moves more slowly and safely.Trees can be placed to screen unwanted views or noise from busy highways.Trees can complement the architecture or design of buildings or entire neighborhoods.Environmental BenefitsTrees offer many environmental benefits.Trees reduce the urban heat island effect through evaporative cooling and reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches parking lots and buildings. This is especially true in areas with large impervious surfaces, such as parking lots of stores and industrial complexes.Trees improve our air quality by filtering harmful dust and pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from the air we breathe.Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe.Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding.Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.Economic BenefitsWell placed trees can reduce your cooling costs in the summer by shading the south and west sides of your home. If deciduous trees are used they will allow the sun to pass through and warm your home in the winter.Evergreen trees on the north side of your home and shrubs around the foundation of your home can act as a windbreak to reduce the cooling effects of winter winds.The value of a well landscaped home with mature healthy trees can be as much as 10% higher than a similar home with no or little landscaping. (Topping will reduce the value of your trees)Some indirect economic benefits of trees are that if we reduce the energy we use then utility companies will have less demand placed on the infrastructure, thus reducing operating costs which can be passed on to the consumer.</h2><br />
