                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sa Pilipinas, hinati sa dalawang kategorya ang bakasyon o "holiday". Ito ay ang <strong>"regular holiday"</strong> at <strong>"special non-working holiday"</strong>. </p><p>Ang mga tinatawag na <strong>"regular holiday"</strong> ay karaniwang may nakatakda nang petsa para rito. Halimbawa ang Araw ng Bagong Taon, Araw ng Kalayaan, Pasko at iba pa. Karaniwan sa mga ito ay hindi na pinapalitan at nililipat ang petsa ng selebrasyon ng mga ito. </p><p>Sa kabilang dako, ang mga <strong>"special non-working holiday"</strong> ay pwedeng ilipat at palitan. Bukod sa Kongreso, maaari rin itong ideklara ng Pangulo. Ang ilan sa mga ito ay hindi kailangang ginugunita sa buong bansa tulad nalang ng Panagbenga ng Baguio City, Strawberry Festival ng La Trinidad at iba pa depende sa kultura ng bawat lungsod sa iba't-ibang sulok ng Pilipinas. Maging ang paaralan ay maaaring magdeklara ng kanilang sariling 'special non-working holiday.'</p><p>Kung patungkol sa sahod and usapan, ang mga nagtatrabaho sa <strong>"regular holiday"</strong> ay binabayaran ng hindi bababa sa <strong>200% </strong>nang kabuuan ng kanilang sahod. And mga nagtatrabaho sa <strong>"special non-working holiday"</strong> ay  binabayaran ng hindi bababa sa <strong>130%</strong> nang kabuuan ng kanilang sahod.</p><p></p><p>Matuto ng higit pa ukol sa holiday: https://brainly.in/question/13207056</p><br />

                            3. The EDSA anniversary is considered a special non-working holiday in the Philippines. Skit was tasked to work on that day (not his rest day) for 11 hours. He is a fast-food service crew and a minimum wage earner in Metro Manila. If he is regularly working for 8 hours a day and 6 days a week
How much is the sum of his daily rate and his additional pay for working on a special non-working holiday (GP1)?
How many percent of his hourly rate will he receive for working beyond his required working hours in a special non-working holiday?
How long is his overtime?
How much is his hourly rate based on the sum of her daily rate and additional pay for working on special non-working holiday?
How much is his additional pay for working on a special non-working holiday?
How much is his total additional pay on that day?
What are the benefits she received on that day?
How much is his total overtime pay for working beyond his required working hours?
How many percent of his basic rate will he receive for working in a special non-working holiday?
How long is his working hours in a day?
How much did he earn that day?
How much is his overtime pay per hour?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To solve the problems, we need to know the following information:</p><p></p><p>Skit's regular working hours per day: 8 hours</p><p>Skit's regular working days per week: 6 days</p><p>Skit's hourly rate: minimum wage in Metro Manila</p><p>Skit's working hours on EDSA anniversary: 11 hours</p><p>Using this information, we can now solve the problems:</p><p></p><p>1. The sum of Skit's daily rate and additional pay for working on a special non-working holiday (GP1) is:</p><p></p><p>Daily rate = hourly rate x regular working hours per day</p><p>= hourly rate x 8</p><p></p><p>Additional pay for working on a special non-working holiday (GP1) = hourly rate x 1.3 x 8</p><p></p><p>Sum = Daily rate + Additional pay for GP1</p><p>= (hourly rate x 8) + (hourly rate x 1.3 x 8)</p><p>= hourly rate x 8 x (1 + 1.3)</p><p>= hourly rate x 8 x 2.3</p><p></p><p>2. Skit will receive 30% of his hourly rate for working beyond his required working hours in a special non-working holiday. This is because the computation for overtime pay during special non-working holidays is: hourly rate x 1.3 x 130% (or 1.3 x 1.3).</p><p></p><p>3. Skit's overtime hours on that day is 3 hours, computed as: 11 hours - 8 hours (regular working hours).</p><p></p><p>4. Skit's hourly rate based on the sum of his daily rate and additional pay for working on a special non-working holiday is:</p><p></p><p>Hourly rate = Sum / (8 x 2.3)</p><p>= (hourly rate x 8 x 2.3) / (8 x 2.3)</p><p>= hourly rate</p><p></p><p>Therefore, his hourly rate remains the same.</p><p></p><p>5. Skit's additional pay for working on a special non-working holiday is:</p><p></p><p>Additional pay for GP1 = hourly rate x 1.3 x 8</p><p>Skit's total additional pay on that day is:</p><p></p><p>6. Total additional pay = Additional pay for GP1 + Overtime pay</p><p>= (hourly rate x 1.3 x 8) + (hourly rate x 1.3 x 130% x 3)</p><p>= hourly rate x 1.3 x (8 + 3 x 1.3)</p><p></p><p>7. Skit is entitled to receive the following benefits on that day:</p><p></p><p>a. Additional pay for working on a special non-working holiday</p><p>b. Overtime pay</p><p>c. If Skit worked for at least 8 hours on that day, he is entitled to an additional 30% of his hourly rate (or his hourly rate x 1.3) as a night shift differential since he worked from 9 PM to 11 PM (computed as 8 hours + 3 hours - 10 PM).</p><p></p><p>8. Skit's total overtime pay for working beyond his required working hours is:</p><p></p><p>Overtime pay = hourly rate x 1.3 x 130% x 3</p><p></p><p>9. Skit will receive 130% of his basic rate for working on a special non-working holiday. This is because the computation for pay during special non-working holidays is: hourly rate x 1.3.</p><p></p><p>10. Skit's working hours in a day is 11 hours.</p><p></p><p>11. To compute for Skit's total pay on that day, we need to consider the following:</p><p></p><p>Regular pay: hourly rate x 8 hours</p><p>Additional pay for GP1: hourly rate x 1.3 x</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
