                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Philippines is home to a long and rich history of excellence in visual arts. This tradition started as early as the 19th century with Damian Domingo, also known as the Father of Filipino Painting, who was the first Filipino to paint a self-portrait. He was followed by greats such as Juan Luna, who painted the world-renowned Spoliarium, andFabián de la Rosa, uncle and mentor to Fernando Amorsolo.</p><p></p><p>Fernando Amorsolo (1972)</p><p>You can’t talk about Philippine painting without talking about Fernando Amorsolo, who is also known as the Grand Old Man of Philippine Art. Born in Manila, he was educated at the Art School of the Liceo de Manila, the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts, and spent time abroad in Spain and the United States. Lauded for his skill in depicting light and form, Amorsolo is well known for his paintings of idyllic Philippine rural life. He rejected Western ideals of beauty and sought to promote Filipino beauty instead, and his use of chiaroscuro became an artistic trademark that set his work apart from the rest. Some of his most famous pieces include Maiden in a Stream (1921), The Mestiza (1943), and Planting Rice (1946).</p><br />
