The city government is trying its best to come up with ways to at least ease the traffic fever. First, number coding is enforced, based on the plate numbers of vehicles. Another help being tried is the truck ban for certain hours. Other solutions suggested is to drop the window driving in the coding scheme, to totally ban trucks at daytime. And to regulate the scale of cars and other vehicles. 17. Speakers contain magnets. Magnetism can damage floppy disks, hard drives, backup tapes, and even a few electronic devices. Put your new speakers too close to the monitor, for instance, and you may see a distortion of color and resolution – a distortion that can become permanent.18. India has the second largest population in the world. One of the major challenges facing Delhi today is the lack of affordable housing. Many solutions have been considered to solve this problem. One of these is that the government could coordinate efforts to upgrade these areas and provide basic services such as water supply, sewerage, and electricity. Another is that the government policies should implement to regularize and expand these unsanctioned settlements. If the settlements are better regulated and offer basic services, the housing shortage may begin to be alleviated. 19. For over 20 years now biologists have been alarmed a situation that certain populations of amphibians have been decreasing. To address this problem biologists are documenting method that involves counting species over the course of several years and under a variety of climatic conditions. This method should yield reliable data that will help researchers understand the extent to which amphibian populations are in danger and begin to determine the answers to the problem. 20. In the country Ghana, most of the people have problems in transportation. They do not have enough money to afford a car. The people of Ghana are also too poor to finance the construction of factories that build traditional steel bikes. One effective solution is to provide a bike made of bamboo. It has qualities that make it as good as steel for building a durable, comfortable vehicle. Now, you can see bamboo bikes in the streets of Ghana being used by the local everyday.

                                            Platform-dependent unsigned integer type.
LongWord represents a subset of the natural numbers. LongWord size and range depend on the target platform:
On 32-bit platforms and 64-bit Windows platforms, LongWord is a 4-byte unsigned integer with the range [0 .. 4294967295] (0 through 232-1).
Note: 32-bit platforms include 32-bit Windows, 32-bit macOS, 32-bit iOS, and Android.
On 64-bit POSIX platforms (iOS and Linux), LongWord is an 8-byte unsigned integer with the range [0 .. 18446744073709551615] (0 through 264-1).
Note: If you want to use a 4-byte unsigned integer type, use FixedUInt or Cardinal.

                                            Platform-dependent unsigned integer type.
LongWord represents a subset of the natural numbers. LongWord size and range depend on the target platform:
On 32-bit platforms and 64-bit Windows platforms, LongWord is a 4-byte unsigned integer with the range [0 .. 4294967295] (0 through 232-1).
Note: 32-bit platforms include 32-bit Windows, 32-bit macOS, 32-bit iOS, and Android.
On 64-bit POSIX platforms (iOS and Linux), LongWord is an 8-byte unsigned integer with the range [0 .. 18446744073709551615] (0 through 264-1).
Note: If you want to use a 4-byte unsigned integer type, use FixedUInt or Cardinal.

The monstrous traffic problem in the city has been haunting motorists for several decades. The citygovernment is trying its best to come up with ways to at least ease the traffic fever. First, number coding is enforced,based on the plate numbers of vehicles. Another help being tried is the truck ban for certain hours. Other solutionssuggested is to drop the window driving in the coding scheme, to totally ban trucks at daytime. And to regulate thescale of cars and other vehicles17. Speakers contain magnets. Magnetism can damage floppy disks, hard drives, backup tapes, and even a fewelectronic devices. Put your new speakers too close to the monitor, for instance, and you may see a distortion of colorand resolution - a distortion that can become permanent.18. India has the second largest population in the world. One of the major challenges facing Delhi today is thelack of affordable housing. Many solutions have been considered to solve this problem. One of these is that thegovernment could coordinate efforts to upgrade these areas and provide basic services such as water supply, sewerage,and electricity. Another is that the government policies should implement to regularize and expand these un sanctionedsettlements. If the settlements are better regulated and offer basic services, the housing shortage may begin to bealleviated.19. For over 20 years now biologists have been alarmed a situation that certain populations of amphibians havebeen decreasing. To address this problem biologists are documenting method that involves counting species over thecourse of several years and under a variety of climatic conditions. This method should yield reliable data that will helpresearchers understand the extent to which amphibian populations are in danger and begin to determine the answers tothe problem20. In the country Ghana, most of the people have problems in transportation. They do not have enough moneyto afford a car. The people of Ghana are also too poor to finance the construction of factories that build traditional steelbikes. One effective solution is to provide a bike made of bamboo. It has qualities that make it as good as steel forbuilding a durable, comfortable vehicle. Now, you can see bamboo bikes in the streets of Ghana being used by thelocal everyday​</a>

India has the second largest population in the world. One of the major challenges facing Delhi today is the lack of affordable housing. Many solutions have been considered to solve this problem. One of these is that the government could coordinate efforts to upgrade these areas and provide basic services such as water supply, sewerage, and electricity. Another is that the government policies should implement to regularize and expand these unsanctioned settlements. If the settlements are better regulated and offer basic services, the housing shortage may begin to be alleviated. 19. For over 20 years now biologists have been alarmed a situation that certain populations of amphibians have been decreasing. To address this problem biologists are documenting method that involves counting species over the course of several years and under a variety of climatic conditions. This method should yield reliable data that will help researchers understand the extent to which amphibian populations are in danger and begin to determine the answers to the problem. 20. In the country Ghana, most of the people have problems in transportation. They do not have enough money to afford a car. The people of Ghana are also too poor to finance the construction of factories that build traditional steel bikes. One effective solution is to provide a bike made of bamboo. It has qualities that make it as good as steel for building a durable, comfortable vehicle. Now, you can see bamboo bikes in the streets of Ghana being used by the local everyday.

LongWord represents a subset of the natural numbers. LongWord size and range depend on the target platform:
On 32-bit platforms and 64-bit Windows platforms, LongWord is a 4-byte unsigned integer with the range [0 .. 4294967295] (0 through 232-1).
Note: 32-bit platforms include 32-bit Windows, 32-bit macOS, 32-bit iOS, and Android.
On 64-bit POSIX platforms (iOS and Linux), LongWord is an 8-byte unsigned integer with the range [0 .. 18446744073709551615] (0 through 264-1).
Note: If you want to use a 4-byte unsigned integer type, use FixedUInt or Cardinal.

The monstrous traffic problem in the city has been haunting motorists for several decades. The citygovernment is trying its best to come up with ways to at least ease the traffic fever. First, number coding is enforced,based on the plate numbers of vehicles. Another help being tried is the truck ban for certain hours. Other solutionssuggested is to drop the window driving in the coding scheme, to totally ban trucks at daytime. And to regulate thescale of cars and other vehicles17. Speakers contain magnets. Magnetism can damage floppy disks, hard drives, backup tapes, and even a fewelectronic devices. Put your new speakers too close to the monitor, for instance, and you may see a distortion of colorand resolution - a distortion that can become permanent.18. India has the second largest population in the world. One of the major challenges facing Delhi today is thelack of affordable housing. Many solutions have been considered to solve this problem. One of these is that thegovernment could coordinate efforts to upgrade these areas and provide basic services such as water supply, sewerage,and electricity. Another is that the government policies should implement to regularize and expand these un sanctionedsettlements. If the settlements are better regulated and offer basic services, the housing shortage may begin to bealleviated.19. For over 20 years now biologists have been alarmed a situation that certain populations of amphibians havebeen decreasing. To address this problem biologists are documenting method that involves counting species over thecourse of several years and under a variety of climatic conditions. This method should yield reliable data that will helpresearchers understand the extent to which amphibian populations are in danger and begin to determine the answers tothe problem20. In the country Ghana, most of the people have problems in transportation. They do not have enough moneyto afford a car. The people of Ghana are also too poor to finance the construction of factories that build traditional steelbikes. One effective solution is to provide a bike made of bamboo. It has qualities that make it as good as steel forbuilding a durable, comfortable vehicle. Now, you can see bamboo bikes in the streets of Ghana being used by thelocal everyday​</h2><br />

                            25. Platform-dependent unsigned integer type.
LongWord represents a subset of the natural numbers. LongWord size and range depend on the target platform:
On 32-bit platforms and 64-bit Windows platforms, LongWord is a 4-byte unsigned integer with the range [0 .. 4294967295] (0 through 232-1).
Note: 32-bit platforms include 32-bit Windows, 32-bit macOS, 32-bit iOS, and Android.
On 64-bit POSIX platforms (iOS and Linux), LongWord is an 8-byte unsigned integer with the range [0 .. 18446744073709551615] (0 through 264-1).
Note: If you want to use a 4-byte unsigned integer type, use FixedUInt or Cardinal.
