He always seeks attention and often causes trouble in school. He confides to the guidance counselor that his parents neglect him because they are so pre-occupied with their jobs. One day, Gelo got into trouble with a Grade 10 student because he courted a girl who was already the girlfriend of the 10th grader. The 10th Grader confronted Gelo but Gelo fought back. Angry, the 10th Grader reported the incident to his clan. What do you think will happen? </a>

                            30. 2.  Mr. and Mrs. De Lara are both working parents. They have a son named Gelo who is in Grade 9. Gelo is an average student with attention problems. He always seeks attention and often causes trouble in school. He confides to the guidance counselor that his parents neglect him because they are so pre-occupied with their jobs. One day, Gelo got into trouble with a Grade 10 student because he courted a girl who was already the girlfriend of the 10th grader. The 10th Grader confronted Gelo but Gelo fought back. Angry, the 10th Grader reported the incident to his clan. What do you think will happen? </h2><br />
                        Something bad may happen, the Grade 10 might call his other friends to teach him a lesson. I think that Gelo will be beaten up by the 10th Grader's clan because the 10th Grader seemed to be seeking for revenge since Gelo fought back to him.<br />
