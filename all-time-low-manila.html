My advocacy is to bring back love and joy to the streets- with focus on the homeless kids and senior citizens.Theres been a rubble of blood , hopelessness , darkness on our streets and with Manila street love,we try to introduce some light and love via our mobile outreach and campaigns.Why is it important to me? I drive around the streets almost every day and I don't really see much help is given.We forget they are people too and if we can make an impact at the moment why not? If we want to develop as a society ,we need to connect and move forward together . Ultimately , I'd like to promote a culture of high uplifting the low,and love overpowering hate.How would you encourage others to do their own part? For the past 10 outreach I've organized , I've been adopting the Pinoy value of " bayanihan " For every outreach ,I invite a handful of volunteers and donors to take part and chip in.I encourage the young to go out there and hold your own outreach . It's not all about material things all the time-its taking time ,sharing what you got ,laughing with the kids ,buying for the hardworking street vendors.Leave trails of smiles ,not trash.{legit answer please}&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;​</a>

Parents spend all their time and money trying to get the latest, most exciting gifts for their children. Children think about nothing but what their relatives and friends will give them. The most important Christmas decoration in most homes is the presents under the tree, not the baby Jesus in the nativity scene or the angel on top of the tree. Christmas should be about the things Jesus taught, about giving, not getting, about being together, not spending money on each other.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________2. MANILA -- When the Philippines' telecom challenger DITO Telecommunity picked March 28 to showcase its brand new network, the date was carefully chosen to honor the man who made it all possible -- Rodrigo Duterte. Timing it with the Philippine President's birthday would show the close ties between the leader and China Telecom-backed DITO, the company Duterte is hoping will break up the country's long-standing telecom duopoly. But what the company had hoped would be a splash became instead a low-key "internal" event after most areas in the country were put on lockdown to fight the spread of the COVID-19. Nor is it the only milestone the company has struggled to hit. A "technical audit" scheduled for July 8 to confirm DITO's physical network was in place and ready to operate has been pushed back to January 2021, as only a quarter of its planned towers have been built. Definitely, this will resolve communication problems in the country when fully operational.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</a>

My advocacy is to bring back love and joy to the streets- with focus on the homeless kids and senior citizens.Theres been a rubble of blood , hopelessness , darkness on our streets and with Manila street love,we try to introduce some light and love via our mobile outreach and campaigns.Why is it important to me? I drive around the streets almost every day and I don't really see much help is given.We forget they are people too and if we can make an impact at the moment why not? If we want to develop as a society ,we need to connect and move forward together . Ultimately , I'd like to promote a culture of high uplifting the low,and love overpowering hate.How would you encourage others to do their own part? For the past 10 outreach I've organized , I've been adopting the Pinoy value of " bayanihan " For every outreach ,I invite a handful of volunteers and donors to take part and chip in.I encourage the young to go out there and hold your own outreach . It's not all about material things all the time-its taking time ,sharing what you got ,laughing with the kids ,buying for the hardworking street vendors.Leave trails of smiles ,not trash.{legit answer please}&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;​</h2><br />

Parents spend all their time and money trying to get the latest, most exciting gifts for their children. Children think about nothing but what their relatives and friends will give them. The most important Christmas decoration in most homes is the presents under the tree, not the baby Jesus in the nativity scene or the angel on top of the tree. Christmas should be about the things Jesus taught, about giving, not getting, about being together, not spending money on each other.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________2. MANILA -- When the Philippines' telecom challenger DITO Telecommunity picked March 28 to showcase its brand new network, the date was carefully chosen to honor the man who made it all possible -- Rodrigo Duterte. Timing it with the Philippine President's birthday would show the close ties between the leader and China Telecom-backed DITO, the company Duterte is hoping will break up the country's long-standing telecom duopoly. But what the company had hoped would be a splash became instead a low-key "internal" event after most areas in the country were put on lockdown to fight the spread of the COVID-19. Nor is it the only milestone the company has struggled to hit. A "technical audit" scheduled for July 8 to confirm DITO's physical network was in place and ready to operate has been pushed back to January 2021, as only a quarter of its planned towers have been built. Definitely, this will resolve communication problems in the country when fully operational.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
