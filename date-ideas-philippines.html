    A crucial step in nation-building is exercising your right to choose the country’s leaders. However, you can only do that if you are a registered voter.
You’re qualified to register as a voter in the Philippines if you meet all the eligibility requirements. You must be a Filipino citizen, at least 18 years old on or before Election Day, a resident of the Philippines for at least 1 year and a resident of the place where you intend to vote for at least 6 months preceding Election Day. On the other hand, you must not have been sentenced by final judgment to suffer imprisonment for at least 1 year, adjudged by final judgment for committing any crime of disloyalty to the government or against national security or declared insane or incompetent by a competent authority.
If you are already on the voter’s list, well and good. Just double-check that your record is still active and up to date. Otherwise, follow the steps below to register.
First, bring a valid ID to your local COMELEC office, or to satellite registration areas
in malls and barangays. Acceptable valid IDs are: Employee ID, with signature of employer or his/her authorized representative, Postal ID, Person with disability (PWD) discount ID, Student’s ID or library card, signed by school authority, Senior Citizen’s ID, Driver’s license, National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) clearance, Passport, SSS/GSIS ID, Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) ID, Professional Regulatory Commission (PRC) license and/or For indigenous Filipinos, a Certificate of Confirmation issued by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP). A cedula (community tax certificate) or police clearance will not be accepted as valid IDs.
Next, fill out 3 copies of the form to apply for registration. Get the forms from your local
COMELEC office, or download and print the application form from the COMELEC website. Senior citizens, persons with disabilities, and members of indigenous communities will fill out a Supplementary Data Form, and may be assisted by a qualified assistant.
  Finally, have your biometrics captured. COMELEC personnel will take your photograph, digital signature, and fingerprints. Keep the acknowledgment receipt. It is found at the bottom part of the application form. It will be detached by the COMELEC personnel and given to you.
Besides the registration of new applicants, the following voter-related services are also available: Transfer of Voter Registration Record, Reactivation of Voter Registration Record, Change of name due to marriage or court order, Correction of entries in Voter Registration Record, Reinstatement of name in the List of Voters and Inclusion of registration record in the Book of Voters. If you are unsure of the status of your voter registration or biometrics record, contact your local COMELEC office.</a>

Bernadette)Similar to other countries, the public health system in the Philippines was unprepared forand overburdened by COVID-19. The first case was reported on January 30 when a Chinese womanreached the country from Wuhan, China, and then a few days later her male companion died ofthe virus - making it the first recorded death outside of China (Department of Health (DOH), 2020b;Ramzy and May, 2020; World Health Organization (WHO), 2020a). By March 7, the first case oflocal transmission was confirmed (DOH, 2020a; WHO, 2020a). To date, there are 112,593confirmed cases, 6,263 new cases, and 2,115 deaths in the country (WHO, 2020b) - making the Philippines as one of the most highly impacted in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific RegionEqually alarming is the number of doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who get infected and die of COVID-19 (CNN Philippines, 2020a; McCarthy, 2020). Recently, professional medical and allied medical associations have called for a unified and calibrated response and temporaryquarantine of the country's capital to avoid a total collapse of the healthcare system (Batnag, 2020).Critical but seldom discussed are the challenges of journalism in making sense of the rapid spread and devastating impact of COVID-19 in the Philippines and how the pandemic is also gradually transforming journalism in the country.Questions: 1.

                                            Direction: Read and study the article. Conduct a SWOT Analysis. The Philippines telecommunications industry has long been dominated by legacy players Philippine Long-Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) and Globe Telecom. A lack of regulatory intervention by the Government has led to an extremely saturated market with a duopoly that does not foster competition. Speedtest Global Index documents Philippine mobile internet speed at 14.24 Mbps (global average 30 Mbps) and fixed broadband speed at 23.80 Mbps (global average 74.64 Mbps). The market is split between the two players who offer similar pricing. Globe Telecom has 97 million mobile service subscribers and 2 million broadband subscribers. PLDT has 71.4 million mobile subscribers and 2.1 million broadband subscribers. New entrants, including other local conglomerates, have been hesitant to attempt entering the market. Foreign firms have been even more bearish, due to restrictions on foreign ownership in sectors designated as public utilities. However, the Duterte Administration has sought to change this through the introduction of a third telecom player, and a new Common Tower Policy. DITO Telecom (formerly Mislatel) is a consortium poised to begin operations in March 2021. The Common Tower Policy was also slated to be released during the first quarter of 2020. The policy would have an amendment delisting the telecom sector as a public utility was also supposed to be voted on before the summer. In addition to reforms in the private sector sphere, the Government is also making efforts to reach areas that are underserved through a National Broadband Plan. The plan, with a budget of $450 million, has five components that include bypass cable and fiber optic network layout, national free Wi-Fi, satellite overlay, and the common tower policy. The market will change as reforms are pursued. With full foreign ownership possibilities in the telecom sector, foreign investors will have greater control and likely more significant incentives to pursue the market. The 106 million mobile subscribers would readily switch to an option with better coverage and economical pricing. All players are expected to upgrade their network capabilities, install fiber-optic and sub-sea systems and cables, purchase modern networking equipment/storage/servers, and utilize cloud and cybersecurity services. The biggest purchasers of such equipment would be the two legacy players and the third telecom. Globe and PLDT's 2020 CAPEX is above $ 1 billion, and DITO plans to spend $5 billion on the rollout of its services in the next 5 years. All players are price sensitive and do have a bias of purchasing equipment from China. The market also has a growing segment of smaller broadband providers, such as Converge ICT, One Sky, Rise Enterprise, InfiniVAN, Now Corporation, PT&amp;T, Planet Internet, and Radius Telecom. RUBRICS Based on the article, identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of regulatory reform in the telecommunications industry in the country. In 6-10 sentences, provide an analysis of the effect/s on the Philippine market and economy of this reform.

                                            The discovery of a new human species in the Philippines is prompting a reevaluationof human evolution and historyAn international team of archaeologists, including researchers from the University ofthe Philippines, have announced the discovery of the new species, Homo luzonensis, basedon bones and teeth found in Callao Cave located in Penablanca town, Cagayan province innorthern Luzon that date back over 50,000 yearsIn a paper published on April 10 in the journal Nature, the researchers said they hadfound the remains of three individualswith physical features common to modern and earlyhumans but in an altogether unique combination. This prompted the researchers to designatethe find as a completely new species. Callao Cave has proven to be a treasure trove of humanremains.In 2007, University of the Philippines archaeologist Dr. Armand Mijares-who also co-led the Nature paper-unearthed a metatarsal foot bone that dated back some 67,000 years.While undoubtedly human, the single bone was not enough to ascertain what speciesof hominin it belonged to. This prompted Mijares and other archaeologists to continue diggingin the Callao Caves in search for more remains.Their efforts were met with success when further excavations in 2011 and 2017yielded hand and foot bones, as well as teeth.A comparison of the physical characteristics of these fossils with the bones and teethof other hominin species showed that they were distinctively different from other knownhuman species including our own, Homo sapiens, and a cousin species that lived in Indonesiaat around the same time, Homo floresiensis.Although the H. luzonensis fossils are the oldest known human remains in thePhilippines to date, there is indirect evidence that human habitation of the islands dates backmuch farther into the past: in 2018, a separate team of Filipino and French researchers hadfound stone tools and a butchered rhinoceros carcass-no actual hominin remains werefoundin a former flood plain in Kalinga province, Luzon, dating back some 700,000 years.The discovery of the Kalinga fossils pushed back the habitation of the Philippineislands by over 600,000 years. The authors of the Nature paper suggest that these may havebeen from H. luzonensis,The discovery of H. luzonensis prompts a reevaluation of current ideas about howhumans evolved and spread across the world, and the Philippines' place in the grand storyof humanity. Among other questions that need to be resolved are what H. luzonensis' relationship is with other human species, and how these species managed to set foot in Luzon in thefirst place.Exactly how are they related to us? Did they travel by boat? Unfortunately, the currentlack of genetic and archaeological evidence leaves those questions hanging for now.The team that announced the discovery of H. luzonensis was co-led by Dr. FlorentDétroit of the French National Museum of Natural History and included researchers from theNational Museum of the Philippines, Université de Poiters, Université Toulouse III PaulSabatier, Université de Bordeaux, Griffith University and Australian National University,BAP, GMA NewsPamprosesong Tanong:1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. What is the main idea being conveyed by the linear visual.</p>answerThe visual system processes visual input in a hierarchical manner in order to extract relevant features that can be used in tasks such as invariant object recognition. Although typically investigated in primates, recent work has shown that rats can be trained in a variety of visual object and shape recognition tasks. These studies did not pinpoint the complexity of the features used by these animals.<p>2. What is implied by the visual about the state of farming in the Philippines.</p>The Philippines is primarily an agricultural country with a large portion of Filipinos living in rural areas and supporting themselves through agricultural activities. Recent figures suggest that about a quarter of employed Filipinos work in the agricultural sector which is made up of four sub-sectors: farming, fisheries, livestock, and forestry.<p></p><p></p><p>3.Using only the date presented in the visual.what can you refer as the cause of the situationdepicted in the visual?Explain your answer.</p>Explanation:<p>This statistic shows the importance of selected factors for real-time customer analytics and U.S. organizations' success in achieving them as of March 2018.

    A crucial step in nation-building is exercising your right to choose the country’s leaders. However, you can only do that if you are a registered voter.
You’re qualified to register as a voter in the Philippines if you meet all the eligibility requirements. You must be a Filipino citizen, at least 18 years old on or before Election Day, a resident of the Philippines for at least 1 year and a resident of the place where you intend to vote for at least 6 months preceding Election Day. On the other hand, you must not have been sentenced by final judgment to suffer imprisonment for at least 1 year, adjudged by final judgment for committing any crime of disloyalty to the government or against national security or declared insane or incompetent by a competent authority.
If you are already on the voter’s list, well and good. Just double-check that your record is still active and up to date. Otherwise, follow the steps below to register.
First, bring a valid ID to your local COMELEC office, or to satellite registration areas
in malls and barangays. Acceptable valid IDs are: Employee ID, with signature of employer or his/her authorized representative, Postal ID, Person with disability (PWD) discount ID, Student’s ID or library card, signed by school authority, Senior Citizen’s ID, Driver’s license, National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) clearance, Passport, SSS/GSIS ID, Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) ID, Professional Regulatory Commission (PRC) license and/or For indigenous Filipinos, a Certificate of Confirmation issued by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP). A cedula (community tax certificate) or police clearance will not be accepted as valid IDs.
Next, fill out 3 copies of the form to apply for registration. Get the forms from your local
COMELEC office, or download and print the application form from the COMELEC website. Senior citizens, persons with disabilities, and members of indigenous communities will fill out a Supplementary Data Form, and may be assisted by a qualified assistant.
  Finally, have your biometrics captured. COMELEC personnel will take your photograph, digital signature, and fingerprints. Keep the acknowledgment receipt. It is found at the bottom part of the application form. It will be detached by the COMELEC personnel and given to you.
Besides the registration of new applicants, the following voter-related services are also available: Transfer of Voter Registration Record, Reactivation of Voter Registration Record, Change of name due to marriage or court order, Correction of entries in Voter Registration Record, Reinstatement of name in the List of Voters and Inclusion of registration record in the Book of Voters.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to the Department of Education (DepEd) in the Philippines, there are currently over 2 million learners with disabilities enrolled in public and private schools across the country. These learners are entitled to special education services to help them succeed in their academic pursuits. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of special education services has been severely impacted, leading to a decline in the quality of education received by learners with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>One of the challenges facing special education in the Philippines during the pandemic is the lack of access to technology and the internet. With the implementation of distance learning, learners with disabilities who do not have access to the necessary technology and internet connection are at a disadvantage. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of learners with disabilities who are able to participate in online classes.</p><p></p><p>Another issue is the lack of training and resources for teachers who are tasked with providing special education services. Many teachers are not equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to provide effective online special education services. This has resulted in the quality of education received by learners with disabilities being compromised.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the pandemic has exacerbated the existing inequalities in the education system. Learners with disabilities from low-income families are particularly vulnerable, as they may not have access to the same resources and support as their peers from more affluent backgrounds. This further widens the gap in the quality of education between different groups of learners.</p><p></p><p>In light of these challenges, it is imperative that the government takes action to address the issues facing special education in the Philippines during the pandemic. This includes providing learners with disabilities with the necessary technology and internet connection, as well as providing teachers with the training and resources they need to effectively deliver special education services online. Additionally, more support should be given to learners from low-income families to ensure that they are not left behind.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the pandemic has brought to light the challenges facing special education in the Philippines. It is crucial that the government takes action to address these challenges and ensure that learners with disabilities are not left behind. By providing the necessary support and resources, we can ensure that all learners have access to quality education, regardless of their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Study hard,hope it help</p><br />

Bernadette)Similar to other countries, the public health system in the Philippines was unprepared forand overburdened by COVID-19. The first case was reported on January 30 when a Chinese womanreached the country from Wuhan, China, and then a few days later her male companion died ofthe virus - making it the first recorded death outside of China (Department of Health (DOH), 2020b;Ramzy and May, 2020; World Health Organization (WHO), 2020a). By March 7, the first case oflocal transmission was confirmed (DOH, 2020a; WHO, 2020a). To date, there are 112,593confirmed cases, 6,263 new cases, and 2,115 deaths in the country (WHO, 2020b) - making the Philippines as one of the most highly impacted in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific RegionEqually alarming is the number of doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who get infected and die of COVID-19 (CNN Philippines, 2020a; McCarthy, 2020). Recently, professional medical and allied medical associations have called for a unified and calibrated response and temporaryquarantine of the country's capital to avoid a total collapse of the healthcare system (Batnag, 2020).Critical but seldom discussed are the challenges of journalism in making sense of the rapid spread and devastating impact of COVID-19 in the Philippines and how the pandemic is also gradually transforming journalism in the country.Questions: 1.

                            14. Direction: Read and study the article. Conduct a SWOT Analysis. The Philippines telecommunications industry has long been dominated by legacy players Philippine Long-Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) and Globe Telecom. A lack of regulatory intervention by the Government has led to an extremely saturated market with a duopoly that does not foster competition. Speedtest Global Index documents Philippine mobile internet speed at 14.24 Mbps (global average 30 Mbps) and fixed broadband speed at 23.80 Mbps (global average 74.64 Mbps). The market is split between the two players who offer similar pricing. Globe Telecom has 97 million mobile service subscribers and 2 million broadband subscribers. PLDT has 71.4 million mobile subscribers and 2.1 million broadband subscribers. New entrants, including other local conglomerates, have been hesitant to attempt entering the market. Foreign firms have been even more bearish, due to restrictions on foreign ownership in sectors designated as public utilities. However, the Duterte Administration has sought to change this through the introduction of a third telecom player, and a new Common Tower Policy. DITO Telecom (formerly Mislatel) is a consortium poised to begin operations in March 2021. The Common Tower Policy was also slated to be released during the first quarter of 2020. The policy would have an amendment delisting the telecom sector as a public utility was also supposed to be voted on before the summer. In addition to reforms in the private sector sphere, the Government is also making efforts to reach areas that are underserved through a National Broadband Plan. The plan, with a budget of $450 million, has five components that include bypass cable and fiber optic network layout, national free Wi-Fi, satellite overlay, and the common tower policy. The market will change as reforms are pursued. With full foreign ownership possibilities in the telecom sector, foreign investors will have greater control and likely more significant incentives to pursue the market. The 106 million mobile subscribers would readily switch to an option with better coverage and economical pricing. All players are expected to upgrade their network capabilities, install fiber-optic and sub-sea systems and cables, purchase modern networking equipment/storage/servers, and utilize cloud and cybersecurity services. The biggest purchasers of such equipment would be the two legacy players and the third telecom. Globe and PLDT's 2020 CAPEX is above $ 1 billion, and DITO plans to spend $5 billion on the rollout of its services in the next 5 years. All players are price sensitive and do have a bias of purchasing equipment from China. The market also has a growing segment of smaller broadband providers, such as Converge ICT, One Sky, Rise Enterprise, InfiniVAN, Now Corporation, PT&amp;T, Planet Internet, and Radius Telecom.

                            25. The discovery of a new human species in the Philippines is prompting a reevaluationof human evolution and historyAn international team of archaeologists, including researchers from the University ofthe Philippines, have announced the discovery of the new species, Homo luzonensis, basedon bones and teeth found in Callao Cave located in Penablanca town, Cagayan province innorthern Luzon that date back over 50,000 yearsIn a paper published on April 10 in the journal Nature, the researchers said they hadfound the remains of three individualswith physical features common to modern and earlyhumans but in an altogether unique combination. This prompted the researchers to designatethe find as a completely new species. Callao Cave has proven to be a treasure trove of humanremains.In 2007, University of the Philippines archaeologist Dr. Armand Mijares-who also co-led the Nature paper-unearthed a metatarsal foot bone that dated back some 67,000 years.While undoubtedly human, the single bone was not enough to ascertain what speciesof hominin it belonged to. This prompted Mijares and other archaeologists to continue diggingin the Callao Caves in search for more remains.Their efforts were met with success when further excavations in 2011 and 2017yielded hand and foot bones, as well as teeth.A comparison of the physical characteristics of these fossils with the bones and teethof other hominin species showed that they were distinctively different from other knownhuman species including our own, Homo sapiens, and a cousin species that lived in Indonesiaat around the same time, Homo floresiensis.Although the H. luzonensis fossils are the oldest known human remains in thePhilippines to date, there is indirect evidence that human habitation of the islands dates backmuch farther into the past: in 2018, a separate team of Filipino and French researchers hadfound stone tools and a butchered rhinoceros carcass-no actual hominin remains werefoundin a former flood plain in Kalinga province, Luzon, dating back some 700,000 years.The discovery of the Kalinga fossils pushed back the habitation of the Philippineislands by over 600,000 years. The authors of the Nature paper suggest that these may havebeen from H. luzonensis,The discovery of H. luzonensis prompts a reevaluation of current ideas about howhumans evolved and spread across the world, and the Philippines' place in the grand storyof humanity. Among other questions that need to be resolved are what H. luzonensis' relationship is with other human species, and how these species managed to set foot in Luzon in thefirst place.Exactly how are they related to us? Did they travel by boat? Unfortunately, the currentlack of genetic and archaeological evidence leaves those questions hanging for now.The team that announced the discovery of H. luzonensis was co-led by Dr. FlorentDétroit of the French National Museum of Natural History and included researchers from theNational Museum of the Philippines, Université de Poiters, Université Toulouse III PaulSabatier, Université de Bordeaux, Griffith University and Australian National University,BAP, GMA NewsPamprosesong Tanong:1.
