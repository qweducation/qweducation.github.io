                                            Reading and Writing Skills - Asynchronous Week - Activity 2 out of 4. Identification. Identify what Pattern of Development is used to develop the idea. Answers only. Write the answers on a one whole sheet of paper. Identify the Pattern of Development used in the thesis statements. 1. Teeth bleaching can be done in five simple steps. 2. All provincial buses should not be allowed to pass through EDSA. 3. iPhone 6 has many features that make it stand out in the market. 4. There are many reasons why unemployment continues to increase. 5. Drinking cough syrup may lead to various side effects. Identify the pattern of development in each paragraph. 6. To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented.10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</h2><br />
