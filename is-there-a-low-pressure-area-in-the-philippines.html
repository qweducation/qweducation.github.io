                                            What happens during colder months? The wind blows from the high pressure area in the 9. ______________________ toward the low-pressure area 10. ______________________. The cold air that we experience from 11. ______________________ to ______________________ is part of this wind system. This monsoon wind is locally known as 12. ______________________. As the wind passes over some bodies of water before it reaches the Philippines, the wind picks up moisture along the way and brings 13. ______________________ to the eastern part of the Philippines. Now, what happens during the warmer month? The wind will move from the high pressure area in 14.______________________ to the low pressure area in the Asian continent. This monsoon wind is locally known a 15.______________________ and happen during the month of 16.___________________.</a>

_______1. The wind moves from a high-pressure area toward a low-pressure area.
_______2. There are three types of monsoons.
_______3. From October to March, the southwest monsoon or amihan comes from the northeast and
moves toward the south.
_______4. The northeast monsoon or amihan is warm because it comes from warm areas such as
Siberia and Mongolia.
_______5. From July to September, the southwest monsoon or habagat comes from the southwest and
moves toward the north.
_______6. Both amihan and habagat bring rain to the Philippines.
_______7. Farmers welcome monsoons because they supply rain for their crops.

The wind blows from thearea in the Asian continent toward the low-pressure area south of thePhilippines. The cold air that we experience from December to February is part of the windsystem. This monsoon wind is locally known as amihan. As you can see from figure 16, thewind passes over some bodies of water before it reaches the Philippines. The wind picks upmoisture the along the way and bring rain to the eastern part of the Philippines.Now, what happens during warmer months? Study Figure 17 carefully. What do youobserve about the low-pressure area and high-pressure area near the Philippines? They havechanged places. As a result, the direction of the wind also changes. This time the wind willmove from the high pressure area in Australia to thecontinent. This monsoon wind is locally called habagat.area in the Asian​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>About Tropical Cyclones</p><p></p><p>Oceans and seas have great influence on the weather of continental masses. A large portion of the solar energy reaching the sea-surface is expended in the process of evaporation. These water evaporated from the sea/ocean is carried up into the atmosphere and condenses, forming clouds from which all forms of precipitation result. Sometimes, intense cyclonic circulations occur which is what we call the tropical cyclones.</p><p></p><p>Tropical cyclones are warm-core low pressure systems associated with a spiral inflow of mass at the bottom level and spiral outflow at the top level. They always form over oceans where sea surface temperature, also air temperatures are greater than 26°C. The air accumulates large amounts of sensible and latent heat as it spirals towards the center. It receives this heat from the sea and the exchange can occur rapidly, because of the large amount of spray thrown into the air by the wind. The energy of the tropical cyclone is thus derived from the massive liberation of the latent heat of condensation.</p><p></p><p>Tropical cyclone is defined as a non-frontal, synoptic-scale cyclone developing over tropical and sub-tropical waters at any level and having a definitely organized circulation. In other parts of the world, these are referred to as hurricanes, typhoons or simply tropical cyclones depending on the region. In the North Atlantic, Eastern North Pacific and South Pacific Ocean, they are called"hurricanes". In the bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and Western South Indian Ocean, the name is"cyclonic". In the eastern part of the Southern Indian Ocean, it is "willy-willy", and in the Western North Pacific Ocean, they are called "typhoons".</p><p></p><p>Tropical cyclones can only form over oceans of the world except in the South Atlantic Ocean and the south eastern Pacific where a tropical cyclone could never be formed due to the cooler sea surface temperature and higher vertical wind shears. They develop at latitudes usually greater than 5° from the equator. They reach their greatest intensity while located over warm tropical water. As soon as they move inland, they begin to weaken, but often not before they have caused great destruction.</p><p></p><p>The Philippines is prone to tropical cyclones due to its geographical location which generally produce heavy rains and flooding of large areas and also strong winds which result in heavy casualties to human life and destructions to crops and properties. Thus, it is of utmost importance to have sufficient knowledge on such maritime phenomena for beneficial purposes.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>:: A high pressure system has higher pressure at its center than the areas around it. Winds blow away from high pressure.

_______1. The wind moves from a high-pressure area toward a low-pressure area.
_______2. There are three types of monsoons.
_______3. From October to March, the southwest monsoon or amihan comes from the northeast and
moves toward the south.
_______4. The northeast monsoon or amihan is warm because it comes from warm areas such as
Siberia and Mongolia.
_______5. From July to September, the southwest monsoon or habagat comes from the southwest and
moves toward the north.
_______6. Both amihan and habagat bring rain to the Philippines.
_______7. Farmers welcome monsoons because they supply rain for their crops.

This hot, dry time of year can lead to droughts, where water is in short supply. Heat waves, times of excessively hot weather that include spikes in temperature, can also occur during the summer.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>QUESTION</strong><strong>:</strong><p><strong>what do you have observed about the low pressure area and high pressure area near the philippines ?</strong></p><p></p><p></p><strong>ANSWER:</strong><p><strong>-</strong><strong>High-pressure areas usually are areas of fair, settled weather. Low-pressure areas are places where the atmosphere is relatively thin. Winds blow inward toward these areas. This causes air to rise, producing clouds and condensation. Low-pressure areas tend to be well-organized storms.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>[tex]{\color{YELLOW}{\huge{\underbrace{\overbrace{\tt{\red{\:\:\:\:HOPE\:\:IT\:\:HELPS\:\:\:\:}}}}}}}[/tex]</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>HOPE IS HELP PA BRAINLY NARIN</p><br />

The wind blows from thearea in the Asian continent toward the low-pressure area south of thePhilippines. The cold air that we experience from December to February is part of the windsystem. This monsoon wind is locally known as amihan. As you can see from figure 16, thewind passes over some bodies of water before it reaches the Philippines. The wind picks upmoisture the along the way and bring rain to the eastern part of the Philippines.Now, what happens during warmer months? Study Figure 17 carefully. What do youobserve about the low-pressure area and high-pressure area near the Philippines? They havechanged places. As a result, the direction of the wind also changes.
