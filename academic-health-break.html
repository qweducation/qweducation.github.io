                                            Kristine, a grade 11 GAS senior high school student has received her second quarter written test results in all her academic subjects where she scored lower than the passing percentage. Her first quarter performance was splendid. When she was called by her adviser about the poor performance, she revealed that she finds it difficult to understand her lessons and did not make it in the test because she was sad and hopeless. She just lost her mother and she finds difficult to move on. She needs to take care of her four younger siblings and do the household chores. Her father works in the city and goes home once a month. She doesn't know what to do. In fact, there was a moment when she wanted to take her own life if not for her younger siblings. Tears came down from Kristine's eyes. The pains are so intense, the yearnings for her mother's embrace is so evident, and the cries of the little soul who is uncertain of what lies ahead breaks everybody's heart.QUESTIONS:A.
