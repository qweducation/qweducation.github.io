Candy was so excited for her 5th birthday. Her mom was taking her to the toy shop so she could
choose her very own gift. On her birthday, they went to the toy shop and Candy looked around at all
the different toys. There were dolls, cooking stuff toys, doll houses, and many more. They were all
fascinating, and she couldn't decide which one to choose.
Candy was looking at some huge doll house in a corner when she heard someone say, "Hi!
What's your name?" Candy nodded around but did not see anyone.
"Um, my name is Candy. Who is there?" she said. 
"My name is Polly the Dolly. How are you?"
Candy got a surprising smile on her face. She had found the loveliest gift on her birthday.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>24</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>We can use algebra to solve the problem. Let's denote the total number of candies Li Xin had at first as "x".</p><p></p><p>Li Xin gave some candies equally to 15 friends and had 6 candies left, so the number of candies she gave away is equal to (15 × candies per friend) + 6. We don't know the exact number of candies per friend, so we can represent it with "y".</p><p>Therefore, we have the equation:</p><p></p><p>x = 15y + 6</p><p></p><p>We also know that each friend received the same number of candies, so we can divide the total number of candies equally among the 15 friends:</p><p></p><p>y = (x - 6) / 15</p><p></p><p>Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation and solve for x:</p><p></p><p>x = 15y + 6</p><p>x = 15[(x - 6) / 15] + 6</p><p>x = x - 6 + 6</p><p>x = x</p><p></p><p>We end up with the equation x = x, which means that any value of x satisfies the equation. However, we're looking for the initial number of candies Li Xin had, which must be a positive integer.</p><p></p><p>Since she gave away some candies and had 6 left, we know that x is at least 21 (6 + 15). We can try some values of x greater than or equal to 21 and check if they work:</p><p></p><p>If x = 21, then y = (21 - 6) / 15 = 1, so Li Xin gave away 15 candies and had 6 left, which works.</p><p></p><p>If x = 22, then y = (22 - 6) / 15 ≈ 1.067, which is not a whole number, so it doesn't work.</p><p></p><p>If x = 23, then y = (23 - 6) / 15 ≈ 1.133, which is not a whole number, so it doesn't work.</p><p></p><p>If x = 24, then y = (24 - 6) / 15 = 1.2, which is a whole number, so Li Xin gave away 18 candies and had 6 left, which works.</p><p>Therefore, the initial number of candies Li Xin had is 24.</p><p></p><p>douitashimashite</p><br />
