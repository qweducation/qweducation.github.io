The Black Panther
The Marvel Cinematic Universe has dominated the film industry in the last decade.
Starting with the first widely successful film “Iron Man” starring Robert Downey, Jr., Marvel
Studios has since released more than 20 films, creating the biggest movie franchise to
date. After Iron Man, the MCU has brought dozens of comic book characters to life on the
big screen; some better than others. Among those characters adapted into a film, one
stands out whose film version is a vast improvement of the comic version. This is the Black
Panther. Black Panther’s film version, portrayed by Chadwick Boseman, is a much better
rendition than the comic book version because of better characterization, a more feminist
ideology, and a more significant social impact.
First, the film version of the Black Panther is a better character than the comic
book version. While their identity as T’Challa—the King of the fictional African
nation Wakanda—is consistent, film T’Challa is a more level-headed ruler, who rarely
lets his emotions cloud his better judgment. He also treats his subjects and tribe
chieftains with respect. Integrity dictates may of his actions, even against his foes. Comics
T’Challa, on the other hand, while generally a wise and strong-willed ruler, tends to be
arrogant and impetuous. He is also more condescending towards people he deems
inferior in stature. And he is more than willing to resort to nefarious means or under-handed
tactics to gain an edge against enemies.
Second, the social milieu of the film Black Panther’s Wakanda is very feminist in
ideology. His personal army of defenders, the Dora Milaje, are esteemed warriors
unmatched by anyone in the country, man or woman. The women, such as T’Challa’s
mother and his genius sister, are vital members of the country’s government. The roles
of women are portrayed as though it is natural for them to be at par with the men; in fact,
one would note no social distinction between the sexes. On the other hand, the Dora Milaje
in the comics is not just a personal army but also a harem for T’Challa, from whom he may
select a bride of his choosing. While they are still prominent, the women of Wakanda in the
comics are, in many ways, second-class citizens. Their lives and fates are all in T’Challa’s
hands.
Third, the film version of Black Panther had a more far-reaching effect on its fans.
Black Panther was the first African superhero to be portrayed in comics, which made
the character very significant at the time of release. However, the relatively limited reach
of comics, as well as the somewhat problematic nature of his character, made him more
polarizing among comics fans. On the other hand, thanks to the mainstream scope of the
MCU, the film version of Black Panther was able to reach a wider audience. In addition,
many African and African-American fans were better able to identify with or be inspired by
him. He was a powerful, heroic, virtuous man of color; and on top of that, he was a king.
Thus he became a symbol of greatness for the marginalized.
The MCU has breathed new life into both the comic book industry and the film
industry. Fans who have enjoyed the comics are treated to a spectacle beyond anything
they had once imagined. Fans who have been exposed to the characters through the
films find themselves seeking more material, the original comic books included.
Prominent among these is the King of Wakanda, the Black Panther, who through the films
has become an inspiration to those who once upon a time had no heroes representing
them on a grand stage.</a>

 help plssss</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>There is no connection between the movie Black Panther and the Second Vatican Council. The Second Vatican Council was a meeting of Catholic bishops held in the Vatican from 1962 to 1965, while Black Panther is a Marvel superhero movie that was released in 2018. The Second Vatican Council was an important event in the history of the Catholic Church, but it has nothing to do with the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            2. What is the significance of Culture based on “Black Panther Wakanda Forever” in relation to our topic in Vatican II?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Culture based on “Black Panther Wakanda Forever” is significant in relation to Vatican II because it emphasizes the importance of inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all people. The film highlights the power of community and collaboration and the need for individuals to recognize their differences and use those differences to create a stronger, unified society. The film serves as a reminder that unity is possible despite differences, and that inclusivity and respect for each other’s differences are key to creating a better future. This same message is at the heart of Vatican II, which calls for the Church to embrace diversity and to “uphold the rights of all men,” regardless of race, religion, or nationality.</p><br />

The Black Panther
The Marvel Cinematic Universe has dominated the film industry in the last decade.
Starting with the first widely successful film “Iron Man” starring Robert Downey, Jr., Marvel
Studios has since released more than 20 films, creating the biggest movie franchise to
date. After Iron Man, the MCU has brought dozens of comic book characters to life on the
big screen; some better than others. Among those characters adapted into a film, one
stands out whose film version is a vast improvement of the comic version. This is the Black
Panther. Black Panther’s film version, portrayed by Chadwick Boseman, is a much better
rendition than the comic book version because of better characterization, a more feminist
ideology, and a more significant social impact.
First, the film version of the Black Panther is a better character than the comic
book version. While their identity as T’Challa—the King of the fictional African
nation Wakanda—is consistent, film T’Challa is a more level-headed ruler, who rarely
lets his emotions cloud his better judgment. He also treats his subjects and tribe
chieftains with respect. Integrity dictates may of his actions, even against his foes. Comics
T’Challa, on the other hand, while generally a wise and strong-willed ruler, tends to be
arrogant and impetuous. He is also more condescending towards people he deems
inferior in stature. And he is more than willing to resort to nefarious means or under-handed
tactics to gain an edge against enemies.
Second, the social milieu of the film Black Panther’s Wakanda is very feminist in
ideology. His personal army of defenders, the Dora Milaje, are esteemed warriors
unmatched by anyone in the country, man or woman. The women, such as T’Challa’s
mother and his genius sister, are vital members of the country’s government. The roles
of women are portrayed as though it is natural for them to be at par with the men; in fact,
one would note no social distinction between the sexes. On the other hand, the Dora Milaje
in the comics is not just a personal army but also a harem for T’Challa, from whom he may
select a bride of his choosing. While they are still prominent, the women of Wakanda in the
comics are, in many ways, second-class citizens. Their lives and fates are all in T’Challa’s
hands.
Third, the film version of Black Panther had a more far-reaching effect on its fans.
Black Panther was the first African superhero to be portrayed in comics, which made
the character very significant at the time of release. However, the relatively limited reach
of comics, as well as the somewhat problematic nature of his character, made him more
polarizing among comics fans. On the other hand, thanks to the mainstream scope of the
MCU, the film version of Black Panther was able to reach a wider audience. In addition,
many African and African-American fans were better able to identify with or be inspired by
him. He was a powerful, heroic, virtuous man of color; and on top of that, he was a king.
Thus he became a symbol of greatness for the marginalized.
The MCU has breathed new life into both the comic book industry and the film
industry. Fans who have enjoyed the comics are treated to a spectacle beyond anything
they had once imagined. Fans who have been exposed to the characters through the
films find themselves seeking more material, the original comic books included.
Prominent among these is the King of Wakanda, the Black Panther, who through the films
has become an inspiration to those who once upon a time had no heroes representing
them on a grand stage.</h2><br />

                        <p>A black panther and a rabbit lived in the same forest, but at first, they saw each other as complete strangers. The rabbit only saw the panther as a mysterious predator, while the panther only saw the rabbit as an insignificant prey.</p><p></p><p>One day, however, the panther noticed that the rabbit was constantly nibbling on seeds and foliage in the undergrowth. The panther realized he could relax his vigilance and enjoy a meal of fresh vegetable matter. The panther began to slowly move closer to the rabbit, slowly gaining its trust.</p><p></p><p>As the months passed, the panther and the rabbit grew increasingly more comfortable in each other's presence. The panther found he no longer needed to actively hunt deer and other large game. The rabbit also took advantage of panther's protective presence, feeling safer and more comfortable in the company of the large black cat.</p><p></p><p>The panther and the rabbit developed a symbiotic relationship, where both of them help each other. The panther would hunt and provide food for the rabbit, while the rabbit would help the panther clean it's fur. When the panther had a flea or tick infestation, the rabbit proved to be a helpful groomer, picking out fleas and ticks from the panther’s large body.</p><p></p><p>The panther and the rabbit also gained companionship from each other. The smallness of the rabbit reminded the panther of its own infant children, and the panther would often take care of the rabbit, providing a warm place to sleep or even a small blanket when it was cold. The rabbit never felt alone in the company of the panther, and found himself actively seeking out the panther's presence.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the panther and the rabbit was of mutual advantage to both species, since they both were able to give and receive something beneficial. It was one of trust and care, and each species learned to live side by side in peace and harmony. They were both guardians of the forest, working together to keep it healthy and thriving.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the pair of animals were able to learn how vastly different animals can get along and work together, no matter their size or species differences. The rabbit and the panther lived in their forest, happily in each other's care, for the rest of their days. They taught each other, and the many other animals in the forest, the importance of community and companionship.</p><p></p><p><strong>THE END.</strong></p><p></p><p>I hope this helps po! </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The top 7 movies as of 2022 are led by the highly-anticipated sequel <strong>"Top Gun: Maverick,"</strong> which has already grossed over $718 million at the box office. The film, starring Tom Cruise, follows the story of Maverick as he returns to the United States Navy's elite fighter weapons school years after the events of the original 1986 film. Fans have been eagerly waiting for this sequel for decades, and it has not disappointed, with critics praising the film for its stunning aerial footage and thrilling action sequences.</p><p></p><p>Another highly-successful film in 2022 is <strong>"Avatar: The Way of Water," </strong>which has grossed over $578 million. This is the fourth installment in the "Avatar" franchise, and follows the story of the Na'vi people of Pandora as they face new challenges and threats to their existence. The film has received rave reviews for its stunning visual effects and immersive world-building, with many praising its exploration of themes of environmentalism and indigenous rights.</p><p></p><p>The third-highest grossing film of 2022 is <strong>"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," </strong>which has earned over $450 million. This sequel to the 2018 hit "Black Panther" explores the aftermath of T'Challa's death and how Wakanda moves forward. The film has received praise for its exploration of grief and legacy, and has been praised for its representation of Black culture and characters.</p><p></p><p>Coming in at number four is <strong>"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"</strong> which has grossed over $411 million. This sequel to the 2016 film "Doctor Strange" sees the return of Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular character as he delves deeper into the world of the multiverse and faces off against a new enemy. The film has received positive reviews for its mind-bending visual effects and exploration of the concept of the multiverse.</p><p></p><p>At number five is<strong> "Jurassic World: Dominion," </strong>which has grossed over $376 million. This is the sixth installment in the "Jurassic Park" franchise and sees the return of original cast members alongside new characters as they face off against a new breed of dinosaurs. The film has received positive reviews for its thrilling action sequences and nostalgic nods to the original film.</p><p></p><p>Number six on the list is <strong>"Minions: The Rise of Gru,"</strong> which has grossed $369.6 million. This is the fourth installment in the "Despicable Me" franchise and follows the Minions as they help Gru rise to power as a super-villain. The film has received mixed reviews but has been a box office hit, and it's loved by children.</p><p></p><p>Finally, at number seven is <strong>"The Batman,"</strong> which has grossed $369.3 million. This film explores the early days of Batman as he faces off against some of his most iconic villains, including the Riddler and the Penguin. The film has received positive reviews for its darker, grittier take on the character and the performances of its lead actors, particularly Robert Pattinson as Batman.</p><p></p>Paramount) lapped the field with a domestic $716 million gross? Two upcoming Disney titles each have a chance to grasp Tom Cruise’s bragging rights as the top film of 2022: “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” (November 11) or “Avatar: The Way of Water” (December 16). Before making any predictions — remember last spring.<br /><br />Before its Cinemacon screening in April, industry consensus on “Maverick” was around $325 million — perhaps the fourth biggest domestic hit of the summer. “Jurassic World: Dominion” (Universal) got the nod as most likely as #1 (estimate: $450 million), then two Marvel titles — “Doctor Strange” (est.: $400 million) and “Thor: Love and Thunder” (est: $375 million) also ahead of “Maverick.”<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Thousands of years ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing the metal vibranium. One warrior ingests a "heart-shaped herb" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first "Black Panther". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda. Over centuries, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a Third World country. In 1992, Wakanda's King T'Chaka visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working undercover in Oakland, California. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri, another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions.</p><p></p><p>In the present day, following T'Chaka's death, his son T'Challa returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. He and Okoye, the leader of the Dora Milaje regiment, extract T'Challa's ex-lover Nakia from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother Ramonda and younger sister Shuri. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader M'Baku challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.</p><p></p><p>When Klaue and his accomplice Erik Stevens steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover W'Kabi urges him to bring Klaue back alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to Busan, South Korea, where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross. A firefight erupts, and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross' custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.</p><p></p><p>While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. black ops soldier who adopted the name "Killmonger". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.</p><p></p><p>Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated; T'Challa takes him to the waterfall where they fought, where Killmonger dies peacefully.</p><p></p><p>T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps Bucky Barnes with his recovery.</p><br />
