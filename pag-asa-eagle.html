Inanunsiyo nito na patay na nga si Pag-asa, ang first Philippineeagle bred and hatched in captivity sa Malagos Eagle Center, Calinan district dito sa Davao City noong Miyerkules, Enero 6. The Philippine Eagle Foundation (PEF) is sad to announce the passing ofbeloved Philippine Eagle, Pag-asa. Pag-asa succumbed to infections associated with trichomoniasis and aspergillosis. Both diseases are fatal for raptors.Although treatment was done over a week ago, he continued to deteriorate and died at 8:03 p.m. on January 6. Naging bahagi na rin si Pag-asa sa buhay naming mga Dabawenyo, at isa naako roon. Naging parte na ako noong hatching ni Pag-asa hanggang sa mga sumunod na araw na nag-vigil kaming mga mamamahayag sa Malagos EagleCenter at binabantayan kung ano na ang nangyayari sa agila. Hanggang sa lumaki na si Pag-asa at siya parati ang hinahanap ng mga m bumibisita sa Malagos Eagle Center.Nakatira si Pag-asa sa pinakamalaking dome sa aviary. Ngunit sa kasamaang palad, isang ligaw na kalapati ang nakapasok sa dome niPag-asa. Kinain ni Pag-asa ang kalapati. Dahil sa kinaing kalapati, nagkaroon ng infection si Pag-asa na nagingdahilan ng kamatayan nito.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>These rare eagles have been pushed to the brink of extinction by deforestation, shooting and other human activity. In the 1970s, only a few years after The Peregrine Fund was formed, we began assisting and advising on conservation measures for the Philippine Eagle. Our commitment to help protect this species continues to this day. The best way for us to do this is to provide support and assistance to the Philippine Eagle Foundation. This organization has produced Philippine Eagles through captive breeding and has reintroduced some individuals into remaining fragments of suitable habitat. The foundation released the first captive-bred eagle to the wild in 2004 and has since released several rehabilitated birds. Education in local communities and working with them to develop community-based conservation of critical habitat is also helping to protect this species.</p><p></p><p>Where they live</p><p>The Philippine Eagle, as its name suggests, is found only in the Philippines, an island country in Southeast Asia. While the Philippines consists of more than 7,000 islands, the Philippine Eagle is found on only four of them, all within the northern and eastern regions of the country hehe</p><p></p><br />
