Camille Jazul-Salita, 28, beauty adviser in Qatar Airways, is one those Filipino overseas who came home. She was planning to resign in August but she did it earlier because of the COVID.

In today's difficult times, planning is essential to the success of any business. When a company bus plan to follow, it is ready to face the future. As Book of Luke chapter 14 verse 28 says “Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?"
 If you were Jazul-Salita, are you going to open a small business amidst this crisis? How will you manage the cost of your small venture?</a>

                            21. Examine government initiatives to help finance small entrepreneurs to start up their businesses.
1. Are there enough programs/initiatives to support small-time entrepreneurs with limited capital?
2. Despite the talent available in the local entrepreneurial pool, the Philippine startup ecosystem is not enticing enough for those looking to start a business. How can the government boost the startup ecosystem and better support, local entrepreneurs?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>1.</strong> The availability of programs and initiatives to support small-time entrepreneurs with limited capital may vary depending on the country and region. However, in many countries, including the Philippines, there are several government initiatives aimed at helping small entrepreneurs to start up their businesses. These initiatives may include financial assistance such as grants, loans, and subsidies, as well as training and mentoring programs, and access to networks and resources.</p><p>While there are initiatives available, it is still a challenge for small entrepreneurs to access them. The requirements and qualifications for eligibility may be too strict, or the application process may be too complicated, which can discourage some entrepreneurs from pursuing these opportunities. Furthermore, the funding allocated to these programs may not be enough to meet the demand, leading to a limited number of beneficiaries.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. </strong>To boost the startup ecosystem and better support local entrepreneurs, the government can implement the following strategies:</p><p><strong>a)</strong> Simplify the process of applying for government programs and initiatives to make it easier for small entrepreneurs to access them. The government can provide online resources and other tools to help entrepreneurs understand the eligibility criteria, application procedures, and other requirements.</p><p></p><p><strong>b)</strong> Increase funding for small business support programs and initiatives. This can include increasing the allocation of funds to existing programs or creating new programs to meet the growing demand for support among small entrepreneurs.</p><p></p><p><strong>c)</strong> Establish partnerships with private sector organizations and investors to provide access to capital and other resources to small entrepreneurs. These partnerships can help entrepreneurs to access new markets, technology, and other resources that can help them grow and succeed.</p><p></p><p><strong>d)</strong> Foster a culture of entrepreneurship by providing education and training programs to young people and encouraging them to pursue entrepreneurial ventures. The government can also support startup incubators and accelerators, which can provide a supportive environment for entrepreneurs to test and launch new business ideas.</p><p></p><p><strong>e)</strong> Provide tax incentives and other regulatory support for small businesses. This can include reducing tax burdens for small businesses and streamlining the process of registering and licensing new businesses.</p><p></p><p>By implementing these strategies, the government can help create a more conducive environment for small entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses. This, in turn, can lead to job creation, economic growth, and a more vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p><br />
