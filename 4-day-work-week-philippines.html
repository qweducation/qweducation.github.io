                                            8 A Heritage of Smallness Nick Joaquin (1) Society for Filipinos is a small rowboat: barangay. Geography for the Filipino is a small vague saying: matanda pa kay Mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall: the sarisari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate scratchings of each day: isang kahig, isang tuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the very smallest degree in retail: the tingi. (2) What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick cigarette, half a head garlic, a dab of hair pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things in carton or the dozen or the pound, and in large economy sizes, the exquisite transaction of Philippine tingi cannot be seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little! Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time or those grown-up men haunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns. Such folks are, obviously, not indolent, but not being indolent is just obviously, not enough. Laboriousness just can never be the equal of labor as skill, labor as audacity, labor as enterprise. (3) The Filipino who travels abroad gets to thinking that his is the hardest- working country in the world. By six or seven in the morning, we are already up and on our way to work, shops, and markets are open; the wheels of industry are already grinding. (4) Abroad, especially in the West, if you go out at seven in the morning, you're in a dead town. Everybody's still in bed; everything's still closed up. Activity doesn't begin 'till nine or ten - promptly at five P.M. By six, the business sections are dead towns again. And entire cities goes to sleep on weekends. They have shorter working day, a shorter working week. Yet they piled up more than we who work all day and all week.

The toddler needed milk and they needed food, but had no money to buy either. It had been three weeks since the lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 was declared, and 21 long days since operations at the construction site where her husband worked had stopped. Their neighbourhood of San Roque in Quezon City, the country's largest metropolis, got nelther food nor aid from the government. Caboboy's husband, Jek-Jek, decided to meet his foreman to see if he could get his salary. When lek-Jek went out, he was swept up in a throng of people who were waiting for the rumoured distribution of relief goods. "Someone shouted that a charity was going to give away a half-sack of rice," Jekjek recalled. "People started lining up on the side of the road. The next thing I new, the police came, telling us to get on the ground." Jek-Jek and 20 other residents of San Roque were arrested on April 1 and charged with violating quarantine protocol, disobedience and illegal assembly. Footage of police with riot shields and batons violently dispersing the crowd went viral. Concerned citizens put together 367,500 pesos ($7,350) to bail out the San Roque 21 after five days in detention Critics warn that the Philippine government's heavy handed approach to the publie health emergency is criminalizing the poor for violating quarantine protocols that are impossible for them to follow, quashing their legitimate pleas for food and economic aid, and putting them at risk of infection in cramped detention centers. "While they were in police custody, there was no social distancing. There were no proper hygiene facilities or supplies. Doesn't their arrest defeat the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus? said Kristina Conti of the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL) and lawyer for the San Roque ​</a>

                                            Performance Task 4. Directions: Read the news articles below. Take note of the important details to be able to fill out the table that follows.A :3 nurses test positive for COVID-19 ahter geling vaccine Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19.Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus o day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in. Filipino Nurses United President Moristella Abenojor says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccino on March 1st and even administered vaccines or assisted in the Immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solanle explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That's when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help light the infection. Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder thern from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite lirnited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor's assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. - Carolyn Bonquin, B :CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021 B Duterte to China: PH won't withdraw ships from West Philippine Sea By: Krissy Agullar - Reporter / KAquilarina INQUIRER.net/01:35 PM May 14.2021 MANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte has declared that the Philippines will not withdraw its assets from the disputed parts of the West Philippine Sea while also insisting he does not intend to quarrel with China due to the country's "debt of grolllude" to them, We have a stand here and I want to stato it here and now again.

                                            A Heritage of Smallness Nick Joaquin (1) Society for Filipinos is a small rowboat: barangay. Geography for the Filipino is a small vague saying: matanda pa kay Mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall: the sarisari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate scratchings of each day: isang kahig, isang tuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the very smallest degree in retail: the tingi. (2) What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick cigarette, half a head garlic, a dab of hair pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things in carton or the dozen or the pound, and in large economy sizes, the exquisite transaction of Philippine tingi cannot be seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little! Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time or those grown-up men haunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns. Such folks are, obviously, not indolent, but not being indolent is just obviously, not enough. Laboriousness just can never be the equal of labor as skill, labor as audacity, labor as enterprise. (3) The Filipino who travels abroad gets to thinking that his is the hardest- working country in the world. By six or seven in the morning, we are already up and on our way to work, shops, and markets are open; the wheels of industry are already grinding. (4) Abroad, especially in the West, if you go out at seven in the morning, you're in a dead town. Everybody's still in bed; everything's still closed up. Activity doesn't begin 'till nine or ten - promptly at five P.M. By six, the business sections are dead towns again. And entire cities goes to sleep on weekends. They have shorter working day, a shorter working week. Yet they piled up more than we who work all day and all week.

                                            Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

                                            Manila, Philippines - On the day her husband was arrested, Bernadeth Caboboy had 200 Philippine pesos (about $4) in her pocket and her fidgety three-year-old daughter in her arms. The toddler needed milk and they needed food but had no money to buy either. It had been three weeks since the lockdown to curb the spread of COVID- 19 was declared, and 21 long days since operations at the construction site where her husband worked had stopped. Their neighborhood of San Roque in Quezon City, the country's largest metropolis, got neither food nor aid from the government. Caboboy's husband, Jek-Jek, decided to meet his foreman to see if he could get his salary. When Jek-Jek went out, he was swept up in a throng of people who were waiting for the rumored distribution of relief goods. Someone shouted that a charity was going to give away a half-sack of Ece," Jek-Jek recalled. "People started lining up on the side of the road. he next thing I knew, the police came, telling us to get on the ground." k-Jek and 20 other residents of San Roque were arrested on April 1 and arged with violating quarantine protocol, disobedience and illegal =embly. Footage of police with riot shields and batons violently Dersing the crowd went viral. Concerned citizens put together 367,500 Os ($7,350) to bail out the San Roque 21 after five days in detention. cs warn that the Philippine government's heavy-handed approach to public health emergency is criminalizing the poor for violating antine protocols that are impossible for them to follow, quashing thei mate pleas for food and economic aid, and putting them at risk o on in cramped detention centers. they were in police custody, there was no social distancing.

                                            Manila, Philippines - On the day her husband was arrested, Bernadeth Caboboy had 200 Philippine pesos (about $4) in her pocket and her fidgety three-year-old daughter in her arms. The toddler needed milk and they needed food, but had no money to buy either.It had been three weeks since the lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 was declared, and 21 long days since operations at the construction site where her husband worked had stopped.Their neighbourhood of San Roque in Quezon City, the country's largest metropolis, got neither food nor aid from the government. Caboboy's husband, Jek-Jek, decided to meet his foreman to see if he could get his salary.When Jek-Jek went out, he was swept up in a throng of people who were waiting for the rumoured distribution of relief goods"Someone shouted that a charity was going to give away a half-sack of rice," JekJek recalled. "People started lining up on the side of the road. The next thing I knew, the police came, telling us to get on the ground."Jek-Jek and 20 other residents of San Roque were arrested on April 1 and charged with violating quarantine protocol, disobedience and illegal assembly.Footage of police with riot shields and batons violently dispersing the crowd went viral. Concerned citizens put together 367,500 pesos ($7,350) to bail out the San Roque 21 after five days in detention.Critics warn that the Philippine government's heavy-handed approach to the public health emergency is criminalizing the poor for violating quarantine protocols that are impossible for them to follow, quashing their legitimate pleas for food and economic aid, and putting them at risk of infection in cramped detention centers."While they were in police custody, there was no social distancing. There were no proper hygiene facilities or supplies. Doesn't their arrest defeat the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus?" said Kristina Conti of the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL) and lawyer for the San Roque 21. Questions:1.

                            8. 8 A Heritage of Smallness Nick Joaquin (1) Society for Filipinos is a small rowboat: barangay. Geography for the Filipino is a small vague saying: matanda pa kay Mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall: the sarisari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate scratchings of each day: isang kahig, isang tuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the very smallest degree in retail: the tingi. (2) What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick cigarette, half a head garlic, a dab of hair pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things in carton or the dozen or the pound, and in large economy sizes, the exquisite transaction of Philippine tingi cannot be seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little! Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time or those grown-up men haunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns. Such folks are, obviously, not indolent, but not being indolent is just obviously, not enough. Laboriousness just can never be the equal of labor as skill, labor as audacity, labor as enterprise. (3) The Filipino who travels abroad gets to thinking that his is the hardest- working country in the world. By six or seven in the morning, we are already up and on our way to work, shops, and markets are open; the wheels of industry are already grinding. (4) Abroad, especially in the West, if you go out at seven in the morning, you're in a dead town. Everybody's still in bed; everything's still closed up. Activity doesn't begin 'till nine or ten - promptly at five P.M. By six, the business sections are dead towns again. And entire cities goes to sleep on weekends. They have shorter working day, a shorter working week. Yet they piled up more than we who work all day and all week.

Read the passage and summarize it in 5 sentences Manila, Philippines - On the day her husband was arrested, Bernadeth Caboboy had 200 Philippine pesos (about $4) in her pocket and her fidgety three- year-old daughter in her arms. The toddler needed milk and they needed food, but had no money to buy either. It had been three weeks since the lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 was declared, and 21 long days since operations at the construction site where her husband worked had stopped. Their neighbourhood of San Roque in Quezon City, the country's largest metropolis, got nelther food nor aid from the government. Caboboy's husband, Jek-Jek, decided to meet his foreman to see if he could get his salary. When lek-Jek went out, he was swept up in a throng of people who were waiting for the rumoured distribution of relief goods. "Someone shouted that a charity was going to give away a half-sack of rice," Jekjek recalled. "People started lining up on the side of the road. The next thing I new, the police came, telling us to get on the ground." Jek-Jek and 20 other residents of San Roque were arrested on April 1 and charged with violating quarantine protocol, disobedience and illegal assembly. Footage of police with riot shields and batons violently dispersing the crowd went viral. Concerned citizens put together 367,500 pesos ($7,350) to bail out the San Roque 21 after five days in detention Critics warn that the Philippine government's heavy handed approach to the publie health emergency is criminalizing the poor for violating quarantine protocols that are impossible for them to follow, quashing their legitimate pleas for food and economic aid, and putting them at risk of infection in cramped detention centers. "While they were in police custody, there was no social distancing. There were no proper hygiene facilities or supplies. Doesn't their arrest defeat the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus? said Kristina Conti of the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL) and lawyer for the San Roque ​</h2><br />

Take note of the important details to be able to fill out the table that follows.A :3 nurses test positive for COVID-19 ahter geling vaccine Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19.Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus o day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in. Filipino Nurses United President Moristella Abenojor says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccino on March 1st and even administered vaccines or assisted in the Immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solanle explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That's when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help light the infection. Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder thern from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite lirnited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor's assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. - Carolyn Bonquin, B :CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021 B Duterte to China: PH won't withdraw ships from West Philippine Sea By: Krissy Agullar - Reporter / KAquilarina INQUIRER.net/01:35 PM May 14.2021 MANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte has declared that the Philippines will not withdraw its assets from the disputed parts of the West Philippine Sea while also insisting he does not intend to quarrel with China due to the country's "debt of grolllude" to them, We have a stand here and I want to stato it here and now again.

                            21. A Heritage of Smallness Nick Joaquin (1) Society for Filipinos is a small rowboat: barangay. Geography for the Filipino is a small vague saying: matanda pa kay Mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall: the sarisari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate scratchings of each day: isang kahig, isang tuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the very smallest degree in retail: the tingi. (2) What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick cigarette, half a head garlic, a dab of hair pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things in carton or the dozen or the pound, and in large economy sizes, the exquisite transaction of Philippine tingi cannot be seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little! Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time or those grown-up men haunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns. Such folks are, obviously, not indolent, but not being indolent is just obviously, not enough. Laboriousness just can never be the equal of labor as skill, labor as audacity, labor as enterprise. (3) The Filipino who travels abroad gets to thinking that his is the hardest- working country in the world. By six or seven in the morning, we are already up and on our way to work, shops, and markets are open; the wheels of industry are already grinding. (4) Abroad, especially in the West, if you go out at seven in the morning, you're in a dead town. Everybody's still in bed; everything's still closed up. Activity doesn't begin 'till nine or ten - promptly at five P.M. By six, the business sections are dead towns again. And entire cities goes to sleep on weekends. They have shorter working day, a shorter working week. Yet they piled up more than we who work all day and all week.

                        <p></p>A Heritage of Smallness Nick Joaquin  <p></p>The essay is all about the Filipino culture of smallness, particularly in their perspective towards society, geography, enterprise, industry, production, and commerce. It also explores how this culture affects their laboriousness and enterprise.Foreigners are astonished by the fact that in the Philippines, people buy and sell small quantities of goods such as one stick cigarette, half a head of garlic, a dab of hair pomade, or one single egg, banana, or any other item. This transaction is known as "tingi," which is the smallest degree in retail.Based on the text, a Filipino thinks that his country is a hard-working one when they compare it to other countries where shops and markets open later in the morning, and activity doesn't begin until nine or ten, and promptly ends at five P.M. in the Western countries.<br />

                            25. Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

It has been argued that the arrest of people like the San Roque 21 defeats the purpose of stopping the spread of the virus. </p><p></p><p>The Philippine government has been urged to implement more effective and less punitive measures to address the needs of the poor during the pandemic. This includes providing access to food, medical care, and other basic necessities, as well as providing economic aid, such as cash grants, to those most affected by the crisis. Furthermore, authorities must take into account the existing social disparities and existing inequalities in the country and ensure that individuals are not targeted for police action because of their socio-economic status. </p><p></p><p>These measures are necessary to ensure that the rights and safety of all Filipinos are protected during this unprecedented crisis, and to ensure that the most vulnerable in society are not further disadvantaged.</p><br />
