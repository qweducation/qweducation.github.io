Kinuwestiyon ng dalawang senador ang inilarawan nilang "anemic" na 2021 budget na
inilaan para sa Department of Health (DOH). Ayon kay Sen. Risa Hontiveros, ang naturang
halaga ay hindi sasapat para matugunan ang proteksyon ng public health sa gitna ng
pandemic, kung saan ang proposed budget para sa DOH ay pumapang-lima lang sa budget
pie sa ilalim ng 2021 National Expenditure Program. Pero ayon kay Budget Secretary
Wendel Avisado, ang budget para sa DOH sa susunod na taon ay tinaasan na ng P131.72
billion mula sa P104.49 billion noong 2020. Samantala, binigyang diin naman ni Senate
Minority Leader Franklin Drilon na ang panukalang budget para sa naturang ahensya ay
nabawasan dahil sa emergency funding na ibinigay ngayong taon sa gitna ng pandemic. Sa
kasalukuyan ang pondo ay nasa P151 billion laban sa P131 billion para sa 2021.

"As of 2:30 [p.m.], President Duterte is expected to deliver his 5th SONA at Batasan," presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a message to reporters. Roque issued the statement after House Deputy Speaker Johnny Pimentel and at least six Palace personnel who were supposed to render technical support during the SONA tested positive for COVID-19. Only those who will test negative for COVID-19 will be allowed to attend the SONA physically based on the event's safety protocols. Earlier, it was reported that Cabinet executives who tested negative are attending the SONA at the Batasan - Secretaries Menardo Guevarra (Justice), Wendel Avisado (Budget and Management) and Delfin Lorenzana (Defense) as well as presidential spokesperson Harry Roque. Secretaries Eduardo Año (Interior and Local Government) and William Dar (Agriculture) as well as Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles will also be present during the event, according to a separate report by dzBB's Tuesday Niu. Duterte will deliver his SONA before a joint session of Congress at 4 p.m. ​</a>

Roque: Duterte to deliver SONA at Batasan even as some expected attendees tested positive for COVID-19 Published on July 27, 2020 @ 2:50pm and Updated @ 2:53pm President Rodrigo Duterte will still deliver his fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA) at the Batasang Pambansa even as some individuals expected to attend the event have contracted COVID-19, Malacañang said Monday. “As of 2:30 [p.m.], President Duterte is expected to deliver his 5th SONA at Batasan,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a message to reporters.

Kinuwestiyon ng dalawang senador ang inilarawan nilang "anemic" na 2021 budget na
inilaan para sa Department of Health (DOH). Ayon kay Sen. Risa Hontiveros, ang naturang
halaga ay hindi sasapat para matugunan ang proteksyon ng public health sa gitna ng
pandemic, kung saan ang proposed budget para sa DOH ay pumapang-lima lang sa budget
pie sa ilalim ng 2021 National Expenditure Program. Pero ayon kay Budget Secretary
Wendel Avisado, ang budget para sa DOH sa susunod na taon ay tinaasan na ng P131.72
billion mula sa P104.49 billion noong 2020. Samantala, binigyang diin naman ni Senate
Minority Leader Franklin Drilon na ang panukalang budget para sa naturang ahensya ay
nabawasan dahil sa emergency funding na ibinigay ngayong taon sa gitna ng pandemic. Sa
kasalukuyan ang pondo ay nasa P151 billion laban sa P131 billion para sa 2021.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is understandable that Madeline is feeling a great deal of emotional turmoil after the loss of her father, and it is likely that she is struggling to cope with this tragic event.

Talking to a therapist or counselor may be helpful in processing her grief and finding healthy ways to cope with her emotions. It is also important for her classmates and others around her to be understanding and supportive of her situation and not to judge her for her behavior.</p><p></p><p>It might also be important for Madeline to reschedule her college entrance exam as it might be better for her mental and emotional well-being.</p><br />

Roque: Duterte to deliver SONA at Batasan even as some expected attendees tested positive for COVID-19 Published on July 27, 2020 @ 2:50pm and Updated @ 2:53pm President Rodrigo Duterte will still deliver his fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA) at the Batasang Pambansa even as some individuals expected to attend the event have contracted COVID-19, Malacañang said Monday. “As of 2:30 [p.m.], President Duterte is expected to deliver his 5th SONA at Batasan,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a message to reporters. Roque issued the statement after House Deputy Speaker Johnny Pimentel and at least six Palace personnel who were supposed to render technical support during the SONA tested positive for COVID-19. Only those who will test negative for COVID-19 will be allowed to attend the SONA physically based on the event's safety protocols. Earlier, it was reported that Cabinet executives who tested negative are attending the SONA at the Batasan — Secretaries Menardo Guevarra (Justice), Wendel Avisado (Budget and Management) and Delfin Lorenzana (Defense) as well as presidential spokesperson Harry Roque.
