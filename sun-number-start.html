_7. The distance between the object's two position indicated by direction is called
displacement.
8. The slope of a speed vs. time graph represents the velocity.
9. A bus moving along a straight path is not accelerating.
_10. The unit of velocity has magnitude but no direction.
11. The total displacement of Maria if she started from rest and travelled 10
meters to the right and moved again backwards to her starting point is zero (O).
12. The velocity of the object at a particular instant is called instantaneous
velocity.
13. All things here on Earth are moving with reference to the sun because the
earth is rotating around the sun.
14. Distance and displacement are the two important considerations in
determining the velocity of an object.
15. A ball tied with a string and whirled in a circular path has a uniform velocity
but did not experience acceleration.
16. Objects starting and ending on the same point has a zero displacement.
17. A motorcycle is moving at a velocity of 60km/h. After 30 minutes, it slows
down and completely stops. The motorcycle's acceleration is negative.
18. The total distance travelled by the object is equal to 18 meters if it moves 10
meters to the right, then 3 meters down and another 5 meters to the left.
19. The speed of the runner that covers a distance of 100 meters in 25 seconds is
4 m/s.
_20. The average speed of a boat that travels 24 kilometers in 2 hours is 10 km/hr.</a>

Place the numbers 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 next to the mixed up steps in the greenhouse effect to put them in their proper order starting from the sun.
____ When solar energy waves hit the earth's surface, they slow down, and form longer heat (thermal) energy waves.
____ Some solar energy waves reflect off clouds and greenhouse gasses and return to space.
____ These longer heat energy waves have trouble getting back out into space through the greenhouse gasses.
____ Heat trapped in the atmosphere warms the planet.
____ Other solar energy waves make it to the earth's surface.

The Wind and the Sun Aesop The wind and the sun once had a dispute over which was the stronger of the two. They saw a traveler coming down the road. And Sun said, "Here is our chance to prove who is right. Whichever of us can make that man took off his coat shall be declared the winner." "Agreed," wind said. "And just to prove to you how sure I am of my strength," Sun said, "I will let you have the first chance." So Sun hid behind a cloud and Wind blew and blew until it became cold and the traveler wrapped his coat tighter around him. The harder Wind blew, the tighter the man held on to his flopping coat and hat. At last, the Wind gave up in disgust. The Sun came out from his hiding place and began to shine down upon the traveler. The traveler felt the sun's warmth, and as the sun shone brighter, the man grew warmer and warmer. He began to loosen his coat. Finally, he was forced to take off his hat, his coat and his shirt. He sat down under the shade of the tree and began to fan himself with his hat. "See?" Sun said in triumph. Wind sadly bowed his head and moved away greatly ashamed. 1. What did the Sun and Wind want to find out? A. They wanted to find out who is taller of the two. B. They wanted to find out who is stronger of the two. C. They wanted to find out who is smarter of the two. D. They wanted to find out who is more handsome of the two. 2. How did they resolve their dispute? A. They tested the police on the road. B. They tested the driver on the road. C. They tested the enforcer on the road. D. They tested the traveler on the road. 3. Who took the first chance to prove he was strong? A. The Wind B. The Sun C. The Man D. The Traveler 4. What did the traveler took off when Sun Shone brighter? A. His coat, his shirt, and his hat B. His shirt, his bag and his shoes C. His shoes, his coat and his hat D. His bag, his shoes and his coat II. Directions: Arrange the events in order as they happen in the selection.

_7. The distance between the object's two position indicated by direction is called
displacement.
8. The slope of a speed vs. time graph represents the velocity.
9. A bus moving along a straight path is not accelerating.
_10. The unit of velocity has magnitude but no direction.
11. The total displacement of Maria if she started from rest and travelled 10
meters to the right and moved again backwards to her starting point is zero (O).
12. The velocity of the object at a particular instant is called instantaneous
velocity.
13. All things here on Earth are moving with reference to the sun because the
earth is rotating around the sun.
14. Distance and displacement are the two important considerations in
determining the velocity of an object.
15. A ball tied with a string and whirled in a circular path has a uniform velocity
but did not experience acceleration.
16. Objects starting and ending on the same point has a zero displacement.
17. A motorcycle is moving at a velocity of 60km/h. After 30 minutes, it slows
down and completely stops. The motorcycle's acceleration is negative.
18. The total distance travelled by the object is equal to 18 meters if it moves 10
meters to the right, then 3 meters down and another 5 meters to the left.
19. The speed of the runner that covers a distance of 100 meters in 25 seconds is
4 m/s.

____ When solar energy waves hit the earth's surface, they slow down, and form longer heat (thermal) energy waves.
____ Some solar energy waves reflect off clouds and greenhouse gasses and return to space.
____ These longer heat energy waves have trouble getting back out into space through the greenhouse gasses.
____ Heat trapped in the atmosphere warms the planet.
____ Other solar energy waves make it to the earth's surface.
____ Short wave solar (radiant) energy waves enter the atmosphere from the sun​</h2><br />

The Wind and the Sun Aesop The wind and the sun once had a dispute over which was the stronger of the two. They saw a traveler coming down the road. And Sun said, "Here is our chance to prove who is right. Whichever of us can make that man took off his coat shall be declared the winner." "Agreed," wind said. "And just to prove to you how sure I am of my strength," Sun said, "I will let you have the first chance." So Sun hid behind a cloud and Wind blew and blew until it became cold and the traveler wrapped his coat tighter around him. The harder Wind blew, the tighter the man held on to his flopping coat and hat. At last, the Wind gave up in disgust. The Sun came out from his hiding place and began to shine down upon the traveler. The traveler felt the sun's warmth, and as the sun shone brighter, the man grew warmer and warmer. He began to loosen his coat. Finally, he was forced to take off his hat, his coat and his shirt. He sat down under the shade of the tree and began to fan himself with his hat. "See?" Sun said in triumph. Wind sadly bowed his head and moved away greatly ashamed. 1.
