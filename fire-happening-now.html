                                            As urban populations grow, the cities grow too, taking over more and more land. New houses, stores, and office buildings are built all the time. Land that was once forest or farms is now parking lots and apartment buildings. We seem to act as if we have unlimited land, but we don't. We need to plan more carefully so that we use our limited land in the best way possible. People need to respect Earth and try to preserve it. If we don't, we will lose all the natural resources that we depend on for life. Then what will happen?Thesis Statement:____________________3.In some business cultures, it is the practice to hire workers when they areyoung and employ them until they retire. In other business cultures, companies hire people to do a job and then fire them when they are not needed. I agree with the latter position. In today’s economy it is not important to hire employee’s performance speed, and ability to change. Loyalty is not a consideration. Because of competition, we also need to be able to produce our goods and services quickly. By changing our workforce frequently, we can bring in new ideas. By hiring young workers, we get fresh points of view. A company needs to keep up with the changing forces of the economy.Thesis Statement:_________________​</a>

So, would you now start drinking a big glass of water first thing in the morning or drop the idea? The choice is yours. 1. What happens to our body while we sleep?2. Your brain tissue is how many percent of water? 3. If you drink a large glass of water upon walking up it will fire up to how many minute? 4. Water helps your body-flush what?  5.

                                            The Man and his Camel Once there was a man who had a greedy camel. One cold night, the man went to sleep in his tent. He heard a noise. He got up to see what was making the noise. He saw his camel at the entrance to the tent. “Master!” said the camel. “It is very cold outside. May I put my head inside your tent? You have a warm fire in there.” The man answered, “You have a coat of fur to keep you warm. Oh well, put your head inside.” A little later, the camel said, “Master, the rest of me is cold. May I bring my front legs inside?” The man wanted to sleep, so he agreed. He moved over so there was room for the camel’s front legs. The camel was happy but not for long. “Master, my back legs are cold. Please move into the corner so that I can get them in.” The man moved and the camel came in. Now, there was no room in the tent at all. “Master, there isn’t any room in the tent. I cannot turn,” said the greedy camel. “There isn’t enough room for both of us. I am bigger that you are. I think you should go outside.” The man sat up and looked at his camel. “I knew this would happen. Why did I let you in?” he said as the camel pushed him into the cold.

                            6. As urban populations grow, the cities grow too, taking over more and more land. New houses, stores, and office buildings are built all the time. Land that was once forest or farms is now parking lots and apartment buildings. We seem to act as if we have unlimited land, but we don't. We need to plan more carefully so that we use our limited land in the best way possible. People need to respect Earth and try to preserve it. If we don't, we will lose all the natural resources that we depend on for life. Then what will happen?Thesis Statement:____________________3.In some business cultures, it is the practice to hire workers when they areyoung and employ them until they retire. In other business cultures, companies hire people to do a job and then fire them when they are not needed. I agree with the latter position. In today’s economy it is not important to hire employee’s performance speed, and ability to change. Loyalty is not a consideration. Because of competition, we also need to be able to produce our goods and services quickly. By changing our workforce frequently, we can bring in new ideas. By hiring young workers, we get fresh points of view. A company needs to keep up with the changing forces of the economy.Thesis Statement:_________________​</h2><br />
                        One potential thesis statement could be: As urban populations continue to grow, it is important for us to carefully plan how we use our limited land in order to preserve natural resources and protect the Earth for future generations.One potential thesis statement could be: In today's economy, it is important for companies to prioritize flexibility and adaptability in their hiring practices in order to keep up with changing market forces and stay competitive. This can be achieved by hiring workers based on their performance, speed, and ability to change, rather than their loyalty, and by regularly bringing in new ideas through the hiring of younger workers.<br />

                            14. TI Have you imagined not drinking water or any other liquid within the next eight hours? This is what you basically do while you sleep. Your body become slowly dehydrated or water-deprived because it needs fluid for the body organs to function or do their job while you are sleeping. If you drink a large glass of water upon waking up, it would fire up your energy for 90 minutes. Water helps your body flush out toxins, especially through your kidneys. Since your brain tissue is 75 percent water, it needs to be hydrated enough to operate well. You can feel drained, exhausted, or experience tiredness and mood swings if you lack water. So, would you now start drinking a big glass of water first thing in the morning or drop the idea? The choice is yours. 1. What happens to our body while we sleep?2. Your brain tissue is how many percent of water? 3. If you drink a large glass of water upon walking up it will fire up to how many minute? 4. Water helps your body-flush what?  5.

He got up to see what was making the noise. He saw his camel at the entrance to the tent. “Master!” said the camel. “It is very cold outside. May I put my head inside your tent? You have a warm fire in there.” The man answered, “You have a coat of fur to keep you warm. Oh well, put your head inside.” A little later, the camel said, “Master, the rest of me is cold. May I bring my front legs inside?” The man wanted to sleep, so he agreed. He moved over so there was room for the camel’s front legs. The camel was happy but not for long. “Master, my back legs are cold. Please move into the corner so that I can get them in.” The man moved and the camel came in. Now, there was no room in the tent at all. “Master, there isn’t any room in the tent. I cannot turn,” said the greedy camel. “There isn’t enough room for both of us. I am bigger that you are. I think you should go outside.” The man sat up and looked at his camel. “I knew this would happen. Why did I let you in?” he said as the camel pushed him into the cold.
