Engineer Armando Corpuz- the first one on their remote barangay. His parents and two brothers sacrificed a lot for him and they succeeded. Now, it is time for him to return the favor. He will finance the studies of his two younger brothers in any private school they want. He will build a big concrete house for their family and give them a big amount of money for them to start any business. Ahh! God is very good to them for their faith and perseverance. 1.

                                            Activity C. My Opinion Matters An assertion is a strong opinion that one has about a topic. For an assertion to be reasonable, it must be supported by accurate citations which refer to evidence from reliable sources such as encyclopedias, academic journals, websites etc. From the author’s assertions about the jeepney, what details does she provide to convince the reader that the information is factual? What evidence is there to convince the reader that this is an opinion. Choose three statements from the passage, Jeepney- A Product of Filipino Ingenuity, and complete the Assertion Sheet below.Jeepney – A Product of Filipino Ingenuity (Excerpt)Carmen Guerrero-NakpilIf one were looking for a symbol of post-war Philippines, one could do no better than the jeepney, which is as abundant and as persistent as post-war mosquitoes, and as much a creature of improvisation1 as the post-war Filipino. The jeepney, unique in the world, is a tiny bus built by superimposing a shop-made body on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its drivers, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric2decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way behind the original chassis and when fully loaded, its rear lists dangerously close to the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying twelve people – as it often does when business is good. A jeepney is hardly without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield, the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an imaginative estimate of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not or a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion. They are allusive3, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, the name of showgirls and actresses or slogans. They undoubtedly add piquancy4to the trafficproblem. The jeepney‘s cramped interior has undergone an even more complete transformation. Above the cracked and dusty windshield, there is usually a strip of mirror, ornamented in the Venetian style, which enables its driver-conductor to keep an eye on passengers who have not paid their fares. A central place on it is reserved for an icon or print of ―Our Lady of Perpetual Help‖ or ―St. Anthony,‖ with a bunch of dusty paper flowers or a garland of sampaguitas paying tribute to the operator‘s favorite devotion. Anyone who has taken a ride in a jeepney will realize how necessary it is to explore the intercession of the saints. The jeepney‘sikon is as traditional as the chapel where bullfighters kneel before courting death. Having made his box to the Divinity, the jeepney driver proceeds to be as bravo as a matador.1) Assertion (statement that starts argument)2) Reasoning (statement that supports assertion and explains why audience should believe it)3) Evidence (statement that back up reasoning)4) My Reaction (your own opinion on the author’s assertion)​</a>

                                            Case Analysis: Rem Apparel: Alice Blue Gown For the past 13 years, Ms. Remedios Olay operated her clothing shop located in the middle of the city's commercial district. Her merchandise consists of apparel for men and women. Under her employ are six salesladies. Her shop opens at 9:00 AM and closes at 6:00 PM. Among the clothing stores in the city, her shop is the most successful. The recent opening of two giant malls did not affect the viability of her firm. Many people are amazed at the outstanding performance of Ms. Olay's shop: The Rem Apparel. Ms. Olay' s success can be attributed to her skill in defining what the customers really want to buy from her. The products she displays in her shop are considered elegant and stylish by her customers, most of whom are professionals and middle level business and government executives. She continued enjoying the patronage of her customers until one of her major suppliers ceased operating due to the failing health of its owner. Ms. Olay got worried and she began to consider manufacturing her own requirements. She started to make preliminary moves to operate an apparel manufacturing business. Her first step was to hire an assistant who will initially help her prepare the necessary documents to purchase a suitable lot where the factory will be located. Her next move was to send her brightest employee to enroll in an apparel designing course in a reputable vocational school in Manila. In addition to her other experiences, the chosen employee had worked as a seamstress for three years in a tailoring shop. Ms. Olay is so enthusiastic, and she plans to start operating within two years.</a>

MANILA, Philippines San Miguel bounced back and humbled top team TNT, 83-67, in the 2021 PBA Philippine Cup Wednesday at DHVSU Gym in Bacolor, Pampanga. The Beermen, who suffered a shock 110-104 loss to Terrafirma last week, snapped the Tropang Giga's perfect six-game start to the conference. San Miguel Beer went on a 20 - 7 start and never looked back as it held TNT to a shell of its former self, limiting the Tropang Giga to their lowest offensive output since November 2013 when they dropped a 77-63 decision to Petron. "This is a big game for us and I'm thankful for the players because the sense of urgency is there," said San Miguel head coach Leo Austria as his team improved to 4 - 2 record to get to the fourth spot in the ladder.2. There should be zoos because zoos save animals and help people learn a lot about them. Did you know that thirty species of animals were saved because of zoos? Zoos give great care that most animals don't receive in the wild. When they get sick or hurt, expert veterinarians look after them until they get totally healed. In many big zoos, animals are made to feel like they are in the wild. There are no longer cages, and the fences are hidden. Zookeepers hide the food from the animals so they can learn to hunt, and in some zoos, glass walls are tinted so the animals don't see the chaos created by people around them. I am really glad the zookeepers give their time to care for the animals, and I am thankful we have zoos.Read each of the sentences below and identify its type of journalistic writing.

MANILA-Both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may visit reopened parks in Manila following the region's shift to Alert Level 4. the tourism chief said Saturday, as restrictions remain in place to prevent the spread of COVID-194. With the ongoing pandemic and scarcity of available vaccines, senior citizens who are mostly grandparents and children below 18 years old have been cooped up at home for more than 18 months. Living with both age category groups in one house, especially during this unprecedented situation that we are in, is a blessing,but it also has its fair challenges. Peace and quiet are far and in between, which can be frustrating for those who work at home. But the upside to this is that grandparents can help take care of the kids as the parents go about their busy schedules. Families who aren't fortunate enough to share the same home have to make that extra effort to reach out to their loved ones, more so for those with elders who aren't tech savvy to order online for everyday essentials. Regular virtual calls to check on them have become a staple in routine. Whatever the setup is, we all share the same concern-the wellbeing of our grandparents/senior citizens should be part of our topmost priorities.5. Reading is fun! But should it be required?

If so, can the municipal mayor validly use the exercise of Power of Taxation as a defense?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The determination of whether a business is a nuisance and whether it should be foreclosed is usually within the discretion of the local government unit, specifically the Municipal Mayor. The Municipal Mayor has the power to regulate and control the operation of businesses within its jurisdiction in order to promote the general welfare of its constituents.</p><p></p><p>In this case, if the operation of the KTV Bar is causing a nuisance to the community, the Municipal Mayor may order its foreclosure. However, the determination of whether the KTV Bar is a nuisance or not would depend on the specific circumstances of the case.</p><p></p><p>As for the use of the exercise of Power of Taxation as a defense, it is not clear how this would apply to the situation you have presented. The Power of Taxation is a power of the government to impose taxes on individuals, properties, or businesses. It is not typically used as a defense against a foreclosure order.

                            15. Activity C. My Opinion Matters An assertion is a strong opinion that one has about a topic. For an assertion to be reasonable, it must be supported by accurate citations which refer to evidence from reliable sources such as encyclopedias, academic journals, websites etc. From the author’s assertions about the jeepney, what details does she provide to convince the reader that the information is factual? What evidence is there to convince the reader that this is an opinion. Choose three statements from the passage, Jeepney- A Product of Filipino Ingenuity, and complete the Assertion Sheet below.Jeepney – A Product of Filipino Ingenuity (Excerpt)Carmen Guerrero-NakpilIf one were looking for a symbol of post-war Philippines, one could do no better than the jeepney, which is as abundant and as persistent as post-war mosquitoes, and as much a creature of improvisation1 as the post-war Filipino. The jeepney, unique in the world, is a tiny bus built by superimposing a shop-made body on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its drivers, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric2decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way behind the original chassis and when fully loaded, its rear lists dangerously close to the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying twelve people – as it often does when business is good. A jeepney is hardly without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield, the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an imaginative estimate of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not or a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion. They are allusive3, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, the name of showgirls and actresses or slogans. They undoubtedly add piquancy4to the trafficproblem. The jeepney‘s cramped interior has undergone an even more complete transformation. Above the cracked and dusty windshield, there is usually a strip of mirror, ornamented in the Venetian style, which enables its driver-conductor to keep an eye on passengers who have not paid their fares. A central place on it is reserved for an icon or print of ―Our Lady of Perpetual Help‖ or ―St. Anthony,‖ with a bunch of dusty paper flowers or a garland of sampaguitas paying tribute to the operator‘s favorite devotion. Anyone who has taken a ride in a jeepney will realize how necessary it is to explore the intercession of the saints. The jeepney‘sikon is as traditional as the chapel where bullfighters kneel before courting death. Having made his box to the Divinity, the jeepney driver proceeds to be as bravo as a matador.1) Assertion (statement that starts argument)2) Reasoning (statement that supports assertion and explains why audience should believe it)3) Evidence (statement that back up reasoning)4) My Reaction (your own opinion on the author’s assertion)​</h2><br />

                            22. Case Analysis: Rem Apparel: Alice Blue Gown For the past 13 years, Ms. Remedios Olay operated her clothing shop located in the middle of the city's commercial district. Her merchandise consists of apparel for men and women. Under her employ are six salesladies. Her shop opens at 9:00 AM and closes at 6:00 PM. Among the clothing stores in the city, her shop is the most successful. The recent opening of two giant malls did not affect the viability of her firm. Many people are amazed at the outstanding performance of Ms. Olay's shop: The Rem Apparel. Ms. Olay' s success can be attributed to her skill in defining what the customers really want to buy from her. The products she displays in her shop are considered elegant and stylish by her customers, most of whom are professionals and middle level business and government executives. She continued enjoying the patronage of her customers until one of her major suppliers ceased operating due to the failing health of its owner. Ms. Olay got worried and she began to consider manufacturing her own requirements. She started to make preliminary moves to operate an apparel manufacturing business. Her first step was to hire an assistant who will initially help her prepare the necessary documents to purchase a suitable lot where the factory will be located. Her next move was to send her brightest employee to enroll in an apparel designing course in a reputable vocational school in Manila. In addition to her other experiences, the chosen employee had worked as a seamstress for three years in a tailoring shop. Ms. Olay is so enthusiastic, and she plans to start operating within two years.</h2><br />

MANILA, Philippines San Miguel bounced back and humbled top team TNT, 83-67, in the 2021 PBA Philippine Cup Wednesday at DHVSU Gym in Bacolor, Pampanga. The Beermen, who suffered a shock 110-104 loss to Terrafirma last week, snapped the Tropang Giga's perfect six-game start to the conference. San Miguel Beer went on a 20 - 7 start and never looked back as it held TNT to a shell of its former self, limiting the Tropang Giga to their lowest offensive output since November 2013 when they dropped a 77-63 decision to Petron. "This is a big game for us and I'm thankful for the players because the sense of urgency is there," said San Miguel head coach Leo Austria as his team improved to 4 - 2 record to get to the fourth spot in the ladder.2. There should be zoos because zoos save animals and help people learn a lot about them. Did you know that thirty species of animals were saved because of zoos? Zoos give great care that most animals don't receive in the wild. When they get sick or hurt, expert veterinarians look after them until they get totally healed. In many big zoos, animals are made to feel like they are in the wild. There are no longer cages, and the fences are hidden. Zookeepers hide the food from the animals so they can learn to hunt, and in some zoos, glass walls are tinted so the animals don't see the chaos created by people around them. I am really glad the zookeepers give their time to care for the animals, and I am thankful we have zoos.Read each of the sentences below and identify its type of journalistic writing.

If we will love one another, we will be living in a better world.3. MANILA-Both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may visit reopened parks in Manila following the region's shift to Alert Level 4. the tourism chief said Saturday, as restrictions remain in place to prevent the spread of COVID-194. With the ongoing pandemic and scarcity of available vaccines, senior citizens who are mostly grandparents and children below 18 years old have been cooped up at home for more than 18 months. Living with both age category groups in one house, especially during this unprecedented situation that we are in, is a blessing,but it also has its fair challenges. Peace and quiet are far and in between, which can be frustrating for those who work at home. But the upside to this is that grandparents can help take care of the kids as the parents go about their busy schedules. Families who aren't fortunate enough to share the same home have to make that extra effort to reach out to their loved ones, more so for those with elders who aren't tech savvy to order online for everyday essentials. Regular virtual calls to check on them have become a staple in routine. Whatever the setup is, we all share the same concern-the wellbeing of our grandparents/senior citizens should be part of our topmost priorities.5. Reading is fun! But should it be required?
