                            3. It is also good with transparencies but unlike. GIFs, it does not support animation but it can display up to 16 million colors, so image quality for this image file type is also remarkably improved. PNG allows the control of the transparency level or opacity of images. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Pictures</strong></p><p>Typically, they are digital or electronic photographs or images that you have stored on a local storage device. There are three common types of image file formats. You can identify them by their filename extensions.</p><p><strong>a. JPEG and JPEG</strong></p><p>This is the abbreviation for.jpeg, which stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group. As with all other picture file extensions, it denotes the data compression method that makes the file Internet-compatible and transportable. This picture file type supports 16.7 million colours, making it suited for working with photographic images in full bloom. Unfortunately, it does not enable transparency, making it challenging to integrate photographs of this file type with other materials or parts of your project. However, if you're searching for the highest-quality image to include in your document, this is the image file format for you. JPG does not perform well with text, line art, or simple graphics. JPG photos are compact in terms of file size.</p><p><strong>b. GIF</strong></p><p>This is the abbreviation for Graphics Interchange Format. This image file format is capable of portraying transparency. Therefore, it can be combined with other elements or materials in your work. Additionally, it may display rudimentary animation. This might not be useful on printed material. Nonetheless, providing documents electronically via email or putting copies on a website could be fantastic. Because it can only support up to 256 colours, it is best suited for logos and art decors with a limited number of solid colours. GIF is superior for logos, drawings, small text, black-and-white images, and low-resolution files.</p><p><strong>c. PNG</strong></p><p>The correct pronunciation is "ping. It is an abbreviation for Portable Network Graphics. It was designed with GIF's capabilities in mind. It was developed primarily to expedite the transfer of photographs on the Internet. It is also excellent with transparency, but unlike GIFs, it does not support the motion. However, it can display up to 16 million colours. Therefore the visual quality of this image file format has also been much enhanced. PNG permits the control of an image's level of transparency or opacity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about JPEG images:</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/80869</strong></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A. Cell is made up of smallest level of living organisms and all the function is taking place inside the body</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Beacause  The cell is called the structural and functional unit of life as all living organisms are made up of cells. Cells are also essential for performing various life processes required for sustaining life. Furthermore, cells provide form and structure, process nutrients and convert them into useable energy.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. A</p><p>The circulatory system is made up of blood vessels that carry blood away from and towards the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the heart and veins carry blood back to the heart. The circulatory system carries oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells, and removes waste products, like carbon dioxide.</p><p>2.C.</p><p> Cancer cells</p><p>No, we don't all have cancer cells in our bodies. Our bodies are constantly producing new cells, some of which have the potential to become cancerous. At any given moment, we may be producing cells that have damaged DNA, but that doesn't mean they're destined to become cancer</p><p>3.B.</p><p>Kidneys-are two bean-shaped organs in excretory system.</p><p>4.B.</p><p>This means that in a flower, it can have both the female and male reproductive organ in it. It can also have a separate flower that has only the female or the male reproductive organ. Whereas animals mostly have only one reproductive organ in an organism in which it is either the female or male reproductive organ.</p><p>5. A.</p><p>Because the shoot system consists the leaves,flowers,twigs,stem and others that allow or make the plant to grow. And without the root system,the plant couldn't survive,because nothing will absorb water from the ground and distribute it to many parts of the plant.</p><p>6.A.</p><p>A group of cells working together is defined as a tissue and several tissues working together comprise an organ. The heart is used as an example of an organ which is made up from muscle and valve tissue. Students can draw diagrams showing how cells, tissues and organs are different but connected.</p><p>7. D.</p><p>CELL</p><p>All living things are made of cells; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms.</p><p>8.None of the above </p><p>The levels, from smallest to largest, are: molecule, cell, tissue, organ, organ system, organism, population, community, ecosystem, biosphere</p><br />

Nutrients will sink to the bottom, increasing deposition of soil.C. Nutrients will be used up by aquatic plant and animals keeping the bay balance.D. Algal blooms will decrease dissolved oxygen level, causing fish to have difficulty in breathing.​</h2><br />
                        Answer <br />D <br />Explanation <br /><br />Excessive amounts of nutrients can lead to more serious problems such as low levels of oxygen dissolved in the water. Severe algal growth blocks light that is needed for plants, such as seagrasses, to grow. When the algae and seagrass die, they decay. In the process of decay, the oxygen in the water is used up and this leads to low levels of dissolved oxygen in the water. This, in turn, can kill fish, crabs, oysters, and other aquatic animals<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1.)</strong> All species have a <strong>bicornuate uterus</strong> with uterine horns and a uterine body.</p><p><strong>2.) </strong>The estrous cycle can be divided into four stages: proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. During proestrus the CL regresses (progesterone declines) and a preovulatory follicle undergoes its <strong>final growth phase </strong>(estradiol increases). Ovulation usually occurs during estrus (cows ovulate during metestrus).</p><p><strong>3.) </strong>A mare may be in heat for 4 to 10 days, followed by approximately 14 days in diestrus. Thus, a cycle may be short, totaling approximately <strong>3 weeks</strong>. Horses mate in spring and summer; autumn is a transition time, and anestrus occurs during winter.</p><p><strong>4.) </strong>The phases of building construction can typically be divided into five phases: <strong>initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and the completion.</strong></p><p><strong>5.) </strong>Sexual reproduction <strong>occurs in both plants and animals</strong>. Among plants it is used most notably by flowering plants. The pollen grains of flowers contain the sperm. The vase-shaped female reproductive organ in the base of the flower, or the pistil, contains the eggs.</p><p><strong>6.) Crossbreeding</strong> is the mating of two animals of different breeds. Superior traits that results in the crossbred progeny from crossbreeding are called hybrid vigor or heterosis.</p><p><strong>7.) Outcrossing</strong> is the mating of animals of different families within the same breed.</p><p><strong>8.) Inbreeding</strong>, the mating of individuals or organisms that are closely related through common ancestry, as opposed to outbreeding, which is the mating of unrelated organisms.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
