Volcanic island arc is a chain of volcanoes position in an arc shape.2. The collision of two plates, with one of the plates diving under the ocean will occur at theOceanic - Oceanic Convergent plate boundary.3. Majority of the islands in the Philippine Archipelago are considered as part of the Philippinesmobile belt.4. The Southern edge of the Philippines sea plates are considered as part of island arcs.5. In the Philippines, the highland sections of the Sundaland block of the Eurasian plate includesPalawan, Mindoro and Zamboanga Peninsula.6. The converging oceanic plates will cause formation of trenches and eventually become thesources of an earthquake.7. Underwater earthquakes, especially the stronger ones, can generate Tsunami8. Tsunami is a Japanese term for wave. It is a series of ocean waves with very longwavelengths.9. The leading edge of the subducted plate will eventually reach the mantle causing it to melt andturn into magma.10. The molten material will rise to the surface creating a volcanic island arc parallel to the trench.11. Pandemic is a theory which suggest that Earth's crust is made up of plates that interact invarious ways, thus producing earthquakes, mountains, and volcanoes.12. Developmental volcanic arc are mountains formed as part of igneous activity associated withsubduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath a continent.13. Centennial crust is the thick part of the Earth's crust, not located under the ocean.14. Trench Crust is the thin part of the Earth's crust located under the ocean.15. The rigid sections of the lithosphere that move as a unit is called plateau.​</a>

Continents never move but the plates underneath them do. 5. The youngest rock is found at the tops of the mountain 6. P-wave arrives first at the recording station than S-waves 7. Convergent boundaries produce earthquakes with lowest magnitude. 8. Strike-slip fault can be found in the transform fault. 9. Reverse Fault is associated with strong earthquakes. 10.
