                                            THE STORY OF THE OTHER NATIVITY  In the Holy Qu’ran’s version, there was no Joseph, nor a star. There was no gold,  or myrrh, or frankincense. Only Jesus and Mary and a palm tree.  There was a story that arrived on Philippine shores at least 356 years before the  arrival of the Spaniards to bring in the initial vestiges of the Christian belief system to the  Filipino people. The story was that of the birth of Iesa, the Islamic name of Jesus, as  described in the Holy Qu’ran. There was no manger. It was a birth with no magnificent star  in the night to lead no three magis, who bore no gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  There were no shepherds. There was no Joseph. But there was a tree, a palm tree, and  flowing water.  The story started with Maryam withdrawing, in seclusion from her family, to a place  facing east. There, the angel Jibrael appeared before her in the form of a man. Appalled,  she said that she sought refuge with God. The angel replied he was only a messenger of  God, sent to announce the gift of a righteous Son. But she could not possibly have a son,  she said, since no man had touched her and that she had not been unchaste. The angel  answered that God did this as a sign to mankind, and that this matter was already decreed.  And so, Maryam conceived the Child, and went to a far off place. When the  appointed time came, the pains of childbirth drove her beneath the shade of a date palm  tree, lamenting, “Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight.”  Then a cry from below came—unclear still whether it was the Child or Jibrael—telling  her not to grieve, and that the Lord had provided a stream of water under her. And if she  would just shake the tree, fresh ripe dates would fall upon her. She was told to eat and drink,  and if she would see a human being, she should say that she had vowed a fast unto the Most  Beneficent and not speak to anyone that day.  DIWATA-1  The baseline design of the 50-kilogram micro-satellite is assigned to Tohoku  University while Hokkaido University is tasked with the payload and thermal design.  The payload subsystem includes a high-precision telescope (HPT) with 3-meter  spatial resolution and bands R\G\B\NIR. The HPT will provide surface reflectance data  with its derived products which will be used mostly for damage extent determination during  disasters and calamities. It can also be used for imaging natural and cultural heritage sites.    The second payload is a space-borne multi-spectral imager (SMI) with liquid crystal  tunable filter (LCTF), which has an 80-meter spatial resolution. The LCTF allows for image  capture to be taken at 10 nanometer increments from 420nm – 650nm for the visible range  and 700nm – 1050nm for the near infrared region. Space products derived from this payload  can be used to determine the health and composition of the ocean, identify distribution and  magnitude of harmful algal blooms, and monitor coastal ecosystems.  With a spatial resolution of 7 kilometers, the wide field camera can used to complement  current weather forecasting capabilities. This sensor can potentially image cloud formations  and typhoons. Other subsystems included are command and data handling, attitude  determination and control, telemetry tracking and command, and power supply system.

dominant color is that of our respective birthstones. I am sure that the children will be very pleased. I know you will be. I can
hardly wait to show them to you.”
Nana Emilia read that letter that morning again and again every time she had a chance to leave the kitchen. In the
evening when all the children were home from school, she asked her oldest son, Jose, to read the letter at dinner table. The
children became very much excited about the mats and talked about them until late into the night. These thoughts made her
wrote her husband. For days after that, mats continued to be the chief topic of conversation among the children.
Mr. Angeles travelled to southern Philippines and brought mats for his wife and children. Each mat has the
corresponding name of all his living offspring, even those who already died. When he arrived home from his trip, he presented
the mats to his family. The sorrow heightened when the last three mats he opened are for his dead children who made his
wife reacted with grief.
At that point, Mr. Angeles cried with pain while telling his wife that the three dull colored mats were for Josefina,
Victoria and Concepcion. He added that his three dead children must always be in their memory no matter where they are
now.

                            7. THE STORY OF THE OTHER NATIVITY  In the Holy Qu’ran’s version, there was no Joseph, nor a star. There was no gold,  or myrrh, or frankincense. Only Jesus and Mary and a palm tree.  There was a story that arrived on Philippine shores at least 356 years before the  arrival of the Spaniards to bring in the initial vestiges of the Christian belief system to the  Filipino people. The story was that of the birth of Iesa, the Islamic name of Jesus, as  described in the Holy Qu’ran. There was no manger. It was a birth with no magnificent star  in the night to lead no three magis, who bore no gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  There were no shepherds. There was no Joseph. But there was a tree, a palm tree, and  flowing water.  The story started with Maryam withdrawing, in seclusion from her family, to a place  facing east. There, the angel Jibrael appeared before her in the form of a man. Appalled,  she said that she sought refuge with God. The angel replied he was only a messenger of  God, sent to announce the gift of a righteous Son. But she could not possibly have a son,  she said, since no man had touched her and that she had not been unchaste. The angel  answered that God did this as a sign to mankind, and that this matter was already decreed.  And so, Maryam conceived the Child, and went to a far off place. When the  appointed time came, the pains of childbirth drove her beneath the shade of a date palm  tree, lamenting, “Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight.”  Then a cry from below came—unclear still whether it was the Child or Jibrael—telling  her not to grieve, and that the Lord had provided a stream of water under her. And if she  would just shake the tree, fresh ripe dates would fall upon her. She was told to eat and drink,  and if she would see a human being, she should say that she had vowed a fast unto the Most  Beneficent and not speak to anyone that day.  DIWATA-1  The baseline design of the 50-kilogram micro-satellite is assigned to Tohoku  University while Hokkaido University is tasked with the payload and thermal design.  The payload subsystem includes a high-precision telescope (HPT) with 3-meter  spatial resolution and bands R\G\B\NIR. The HPT will provide surface reflectance data  with its derived products which will be used mostly for damage extent determination during  disasters and calamities. It can also be used for imaging natural and cultural heritage sites.    The second payload is a space-borne multi-spectral imager (SMI) with liquid crystal  tunable filter (LCTF), which has an 80-meter spatial resolution. The LCTF allows for image  capture to be taken at 10 nanometer increments from 420nm – 650nm for the visible range  and 700nm – 1050nm for the near infrared region. Space products derived from this payload  can be used to determine the health and composition of the ocean, identify distribution and  magnitude of harmful algal blooms, and monitor coastal ecosystems.  With a spatial resolution of 7 kilometers, the wide field camera can used to complement  current weather forecasting capabilities. This sensor can potentially image cloud formations  and typhoons. Other subsystems included are command and data handling, attitude  determination and control, telemetry tracking and command, and power supply system.

Consider the following scenario:<br />
One Friday night, Roman and Malou are busy studying for their Logic exam. Meanwhile, Hadji just tweeted a picture of himself eating crispy pata and sisig. Jeff is sound asleep in his dorm room.<br /><br />
a. Either Roman has a date with Malou, or Jeff is sleeping or Hadji is eating.<br />
Answer: TRUE.<br />
Because it states that Jeff is currently sleeping as the story said. While Roman and Malou are not dating. They are just reviewing for the Logic exam. And also, the statement of "Hadji is not eating” is not proven yet. But the letter a has one true statement, so the answer will be TRUE.</p>
<p>b. Either Jeff is sleeping or Hadji is not eating.</p><p>Answer: TRUE</p>
<p>It still states that Jeff is currently sleeping as the story said. While the statement of "Hadji is not eating” is not proven yet. So the answer is TRUE.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>c. Roman and Malou are on a date and Jeff is sleeping, or Hadji is not eating.</p>
<p>Answer: FALSE</p>
<p>Since the letters a and b are answered true, so the letter c should be FALSE.</p>

It then proceeded to Tunis to pick up Filipinos from Libya and Tunisia.A four-month old baby, five government personnel, and the remains of two hospital workers, who passed away due to non-coronavirus-related complications, were among those repatriated from Libya, the embassy said.The 280 Filipinos arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport from Tunis Monday evening. The DFA has so far recorded 8,301 COVID-19 cases among overseas Filipinos across 53 countries. Of the number, 2,740 remain under treatment while 5,055 have recovered. There are 506 fatalities reported so far, according to the DFA.Newspaper Article AnalysisHeadline: Author: Date Published: Who is involved? (people/groups)What is happening?

hardly wait to show them to you.”
Nana Emilia read that letter that morning again and again every time she had a chance to leave the kitchen. In the

Mr. Angeles travelled to southern Philippines and brought mats for his wife and children. Each mat has the

the mats to his family. The sorrow heightened when the last three mats he opened are for his dead children who made his

                            16. 280 Filipinos from North Africa return to PH CMRamosINO By: Christia Marie Ramos - Reporter / INQUIRER.net/ 09:16 PM June 22, 2020 MANILA, Philippines - Some 280 Filipinos from North Africa were brought home to the Philippines Monday night, the largest and "most complicated" repatriation to be carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) from the region since the conflict that broke out in Libya in 2014. According to the Philippine Embassy in Tripoli, which oversaw the repatriation, the repatriates consisted of 227 Filipinos from Algeria, 39 from Libya, and 14 from Tunisia Embassy Chargé d'Affaires Elmer Cato said the repatriation, which was the result of the collaboration between the embassy and employers, took nearly two months to execute as it involved coordination with employers and authorities in three countries. On Sunday, a Philippine Airlines special flight landed in Algeria's capital to pick up the over 200 Filipino construction workers. It then proceeded to Tunis to pick up Filipinos from Libya and Tunisia. A four-month old baby, five government personnel, and the remains of two hospital workers, who passed away due to non-coronavirus-related complications, were among those repatriated from Libya, the embassy said. The 280 Filipinos arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport from Tunis Monday evening. The DFA has so far recorded 8,301 COVID-19 cases among overseas Filipinos across 53 countries. Of the number. 2,740 remain under treatment while 5,055 have recovered. There are 506 fatalities reported so far, according to the DFA.
