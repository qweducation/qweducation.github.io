As a doctor</h2><br />
                        <p>Honestly, I would say no. While home schooling is safe, it may or may not help the student learn lessons that are supposed to be taught in groups. Since learning in groups always boost pressure and the competitiveness of a person, and while being home-schooled, the environment is lacking the necessary boost the learning pressure and competitiveness of a person. It may also cause the student to lose motivation in learning and instead, start to focus on other things like games, reading stories(uneducational but entertaining), or just being lazy, and/or have interest in smoking, drinking, gambling, or doing bad things leading to vices.</p><br />

As a result, online teaching and learning have been used by teachers and students on an unprecedented scale. Since lockdowns – either massive or localised - may be needed again in the future to respond to new waves of the infection until a vaccine becomes available, it is of utmost importance for governments to identify which policies can maximise the effectiveness of online learning. This policy brief examines the role of students’ attitudes towards learning in maximising the potential of online schooling when regular face-to-face instruction cannot take place. Since parents and teachers play a fundamental role in supporting students to develop these crucial attitudes, particularly in the current situation, targeted policy interventions should be designed with the aim of reducing the burden on parents and help teachers and schools make the most of digital learning.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>I </strong><strong>HOPE </strong><strong>IT </strong><strong>HELPS☺️</strong></p><p></p><br />
