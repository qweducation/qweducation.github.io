                                            ACTIVITY 2: WRITING THE BODY PARAGRAPH 
Resource: Handbook for Writers by Lynn Q. Troyka 
The cockroach lore that has been daunting us for years is mostly true. Roaches can live for twenty days without food, fourteen days without water; They can flatten their bodies and crawl through a crack thinner than a centavo; they can eat huge doses of carcinogens and still die of old age. They can even survive “as much radiation as an oak tree can,” says William Bell, the University of Kansas entomologist whose cockroaches appeared in the movie The Day After. They will eat almost anything--- regular food, leather, glue, hair, paper, even the starch in the bookbinding. (The New York public Library has quite a cockroach problem.) They sense the slightest breeze, and they can react and start running in .05 second; they can also remain motionless for days. And if all this isn’t creepy enough, they can fly too. 
－Jane Goldman, “What’s Bugging You?” 
 Study Guide Tip (s): 
1. There are three characteristics of an effective body paragraph: Unity, development, and coherence. 
• Unity is achieved when you have made a clear connection between the main idea of the paragraph and sentences that support the main idea. 
• Development refers to the detailed and sufficient support you give to the main idea. 
• Coherence refers to how smoothly, and logically you progress from one sentence to the next. 
2. Use the RENNS Test to check whether you are providing sufficient detail to your body paragraph. RENNS stands for Reasons, examples, names, numbers, and senses. 
Study Guide Question (s): 
1. How does the paragraph begin? 
2. What is highlighted in sentences 2 to 8? 
Output (s): 1. Identify the RENNS in the example paragraph.

                                            Writing the Body Paragraph The cockroach lore that has been daunting us for years is mostly true. Roaches can live for twenty days without food, fourteen days without water; They can flatten their bodies and crawl through a crack thinner than a centavo; they can eat huge doses of carcinogens and still die of old age. They can even survive “as much radiation as an oak tree can,” says William Bell, the University of Kansas entomologist whose cockroaches appeared in the movie The Day After. They will eat almost anything--- regular food, leather, glue, hair, paper, even the starch in the bookbinding. (The New York public Library has quite a cockroach problem.) They sense the slightest breeze, and they can react and start running in .05 second; they can also remain motionless for days. And if all this isn’t creepy enough, they can fly too.

                            21. ACTIVITY 2: WRITING THE BODY PARAGRAPH 
Resource: Handbook for Writers by Lynn Q. Troyka 
The cockroach lore that has been daunting us for years is mostly true. Roaches can live for twenty days without food, fourteen days without water; They can flatten their bodies and crawl through a crack thinner than a centavo; they can eat huge doses of carcinogens and still die of old age. They can even survive “as much radiation as an oak tree can,” says William Bell, the University of Kansas entomologist whose cockroaches appeared in the movie The Day After. They will eat almost anything--- regular food, leather, glue, hair, paper, even the starch in the bookbinding. (The New York public Library has quite a cockroach problem.) They sense the slightest breeze, and they can react and start running in .05 second; they can also remain motionless for days. And if all this isn’t creepy enough, they can fly too. 
－Jane Goldman, “What’s Bugging You?” 
 Study Guide Tip (s): 
1. There are three characteristics of an effective body paragraph: Unity, development, and coherence. 
• Unity is achieved when you have made a clear connection between the main idea of the paragraph and sentences that support the main idea. 
• Development refers to the detailed and sufficient support you give to the main idea. 
• Coherence refers to how smoothly, and logically you progress from one sentence to the next. 
2. Use the RENNS Test to check whether you are providing sufficient detail to your body paragraph. RENNS stands for Reasons, examples, names, numbers, and senses. 
Study Guide Question (s): 
1. How does the paragraph begin? 
2. What is highlighted in sentences 2 to 8? 
Output (s): 1. Identify the RENNS in the example paragraph.

                        ≤ Bookbinding ≥Recycling paper helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that can contribute to climate change. It takes 70% less energy and water to recycle paper than to create new paper from trees. Manufacturing with recovered paper cuts down on pollution that contributes to smog.<p></p>Binding waste is damaged, misprinted, or surplus paper or parchment reused in bookbinding. Whether as whole sheets or fragments , these may be used as the exterior binding, as the endpapers, or as a reinforcement beneath the spine.Especially in medieval and early modern bookbinding, it was common to use discarded or defective sheets to reinforce bindings, even if they had already been used for writing or printing. This practice has led to the survival of texts which may otherwise have been lost. Binding waste can also help to provide a date, and in some cases a location, for the manuscript or printed texts which it accompanies.<p></p>✍#CarryOnLearning<p></p>More Learnings/Answers:<p>https://brainly.ph/question/3686863</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/10916588</p><br />
