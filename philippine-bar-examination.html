    A crucial step in nation-building is exercising your right to choose the country’s leaders. However, you can only do that if you are a registered voter.
You’re qualified to register as a voter in the Philippines if you meet all the eligibility requirements. You must be a Filipino citizen, at least 18 years old on or before Election Day, a resident of the Philippines for at least 1 year and a resident of the place where you intend to vote for at least 6 months preceding Election Day. On the other hand, you must not have been sentenced by final judgment to suffer imprisonment for at least 1 year, adjudged by final judgment for committing any crime of disloyalty to the government or against national security or declared insane or incompetent by a competent authority.
If you are already on the voter’s list, well and good. Just double-check that your record is still active and up to date. Otherwise, follow the steps below to register.

COMELEC office, or download and print the application form from the COMELEC website. Senior citizens, persons with disabilities, and members of indigenous communities will fill out a Supplementary Data Form, and may be assisted by a qualified assistant.
  Finally, have your biometrics captured. COMELEC personnel will take your photograph, digital signature, and fingerprints. Keep the acknowledgment receipt. It is found at the bottom part of the application form. It will be detached by the COMELEC personnel and given to you.
Besides the registration of new applicants, the following voter-related services are also available: Transfer of Voter Registration Record, Reactivation of Voter Registration Record, Change of name due to marriage or court order, Correction of entries in Voter Registration Record, Reinstatement of name in the List of Voters and Inclusion of registration record in the Book of Voters.

The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented.10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping.

    A crucial step in nation-building is exercising your right to choose the country’s leaders. However, you can only do that if you are a registered voter.
You’re qualified to register as a voter in the Philippines if you meet all the eligibility requirements. You must be a Filipino citizen, at least 18 years old on or before Election Day, a resident of the Philippines for at least 1 year and a resident of the place where you intend to vote for at least 6 months preceding Election Day. On the other hand, you must not have been sentenced by final judgment to suffer imprisonment for at least 1 year, adjudged by final judgment for committing any crime of disloyalty to the government or against national security or declared insane or incompetent by a competent authority.
If you are already on the voter’s list, well and good. Just double-check that your record is still active and up to date. Otherwise, follow the steps below to register.
First, bring a valid ID to your local COMELEC office, or to satellite registration areas

Acceptable valid IDs are: Employee ID, with signature of employer or his/her authorized representative, Postal ID, Person with disability (PWD) discount ID, Student’s ID or library card, signed by school authority, Senior Citizen’s ID, Driver’s license, National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) clearance, Passport, SSS/GSIS ID, Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) ID, Professional Regulatory Commission (PRC) license and/or For indigenous Filipinos, a Certificate of Confirmation issued by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP).

Next, fill out 3 copies of the form to apply for registration. Get the forms from your local
COMELEC office, or download and print the application form from the COMELEC website. Senior citizens, persons with disabilities, and members of indigenous communities will fill out a Supplementary Data Form, and may be assisted by a qualified assistant.
  Finally, have your biometrics captured. COMELEC personnel will take your photograph, digital signature, and fingerprints. Keep the acknowledgment receipt. It is found at the bottom part of the application form. It will be detached by the COMELEC personnel and given to you.

To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations.

Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter.

In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</h2><br />
