Agad na kumalat ang apoy sa buong kabahayan kung saan naitaas ang

Naipit naman sa loob ng kaniyang kuwarto sa ikalawang palapag ng
bahay ang bata na hindi na nagawang mailigtas dahil sa biglaang paglaki ng
apoy.
Sa mopping operation, tumambad ang tupok na bangkay ng biktima na

                                            THE STORY OF THE OTHER NATIVITY  In the Holy Qu’ran’s version, there was no Joseph, nor a star. There was no gold,  or myrrh, or frankincense. Only Jesus and Mary and a palm tree.  There was a story that arrived on Philippine shores at least 356 years before the  arrival of the Spaniards to bring in the initial vestiges of the Christian belief system to the  Filipino people. The story was that of the birth of Iesa, the Islamic name of Jesus, as  described in the Holy Qu’ran. There was no manger. It was a birth with no magnificent star  in the night to lead no three magis, who bore no gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  There were no shepherds. There was no Joseph. But there was a tree, a palm tree, and  flowing water.  The story started with Maryam withdrawing, in seclusion from her family, to a place  facing east. There, the angel Jibrael appeared before her in the form of a man. Appalled,  she said that she sought refuge with God. The angel replied he was only a messenger of  God, sent to announce the gift of a righteous Son. But she could not possibly have a son,  she said, since no man had touched her and that she had not been unchaste. The angel  answered that God did this as a sign to mankind, and that this matter was already decreed.  And so, Maryam conceived the Child, and went to a far off place. When the  appointed time came, the pains of childbirth drove her beneath the shade of a date palm  tree, lamenting, “Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight.”  Then a cry from below came—unclear still whether it was the Child or Jibrael—telling  her not to grieve, and that the Lord had provided a stream of water under her. And if she  would just shake the tree, fresh ripe dates would fall upon her. She was told to eat and drink,  and if she would see a human being, she should say that she had vowed a fast unto the Most  Beneficent and not speak to anyone that day.  DIWATA-1  The baseline design of the 50-kilogram micro-satellite is assigned to Tohoku  University while Hokkaido University is tasked with the payload and thermal design.  The payload subsystem includes a high-precision telescope (HPT) with 3-meter  spatial resolution and bands R\G\B\NIR. The HPT will provide surface reflectance data  with its derived products which will be used mostly for damage extent determination during  disasters and calamities. It can also be used for imaging natural and cultural heritage sites.    The second payload is a space-borne multi-spectral imager (SMI) with liquid crystal  tunable filter (LCTF), which has an 80-meter spatial resolution. The LCTF allows for image  capture to be taken at 10 nanometer increments from 420nm – 650nm for the visible range  and 700nm – 1050nm for the near infrared region. Space products derived from this payload  can be used to determine the health and composition of the ocean, identify distribution and  magnitude of harmful algal blooms, and monitor coastal ecosystems.  With a spatial resolution of 7 kilometers, the wide field camera can used to complement  current weather forecasting capabilities. This sensor can potentially image cloud formations  and typhoons. Other subsystems included are command and data handling, attitude  determination and control, telemetry tracking and command, and power supply system.

Origin: Visayas, Panay
Another creator and counterpart to the likes of Bathala and Kan-Laon, Tungkung
Langit created order out of chaos. He is industrious and loyal but despite his
efforts, his wife Alunsina, the virgin goddess from the east, accused him of having
an affair. They had a big fight, which caused Alunsina to run away. Tungkung
Langit did everything in his power to bring her back to no avail. He threw her
favorite comb into the sky to make the moon and her jewels became the stars.
However, Alunsina never came back and Tungkung Langit lived alone in the sky.
Every time it rains, it is said to be Tungkung Langit’s tears and that the thunder
is his voice, calling Alunsina back.
Text 2.__________ The Sultan Who Can’t Let Go Origin: Mindanao, Island of Sulu
Before the Spaniards landed in the Philippines, the island of Sulu was ruled over
by a Sultan named Barrabas. He was selfish and cruel. And like a neurotic beauty
queen, he was never seen in public without his crown. One day, Sultan Barrabas
was feasting on a massive banquet by himself when a beggar child appeared out
of nowhere and begged him for a bite to eat. At first, the sultan ignored the kid
and went back to gorging on his personal Spiral buffet. The child persisted in
begging for a bite, and even resorted to tugging at the sultan’s leg to get his
attention. In a fit of impatience, Sultan Barrabas grabbed a steaming bowl of soup
and dumped its contents over the child’s head. The beggar boy then abruptly
vanished, as the sultan collapsed to the floor. He died shortly after and was given
a funeral without much fanfare. Some months after a new sultan was crowned, a
tree took root on the previous ruler’s grave. On its branches hung fruits with
protrusions on the bottom that looked like tiny crowns, much like the one that
Sultan Barrabas never took off. It wasn’t long before people started calling the
small green orbs “barrabas” (which later evolved to bayabas), after the king whose
face and disposition was as sour as the fruits’ flesh.
Text 3. ___________ Huhud ni Aliguyon Origin: Luzon, Ifugao Province In a village
called Hannanga, a boy named Aliguyon was born. He was the son of the village's
leader, Amtalao, and his wife Dumulao. He was a brilliant and intelligent young man
who was always eager to learn and listen to the stories and teachings of his father.
Indeed, he learned many useful things. He knew how to do proper combat, and even
how to chant a few magic spells. Aliguyon showed promise and great leadership at an
early age, which earned the awe and amazement of his fellow villagers, even children.
During his teenage years, he decided to go into battle with his father's enemy,
Pangaiwan of the village of Daligdigan. However, his challenge was not personally
answered by Pangaiwan. Instead, he went face-to-face with Pangaiwan's fierce son,
Pumbakhayon. Pumbakhayon was just as skilled in the arts of war and magic as
Aliguyon. Upon battle, without hesitation, Aliguyon hurled a spear towards
Pumbakhayon. Without blinking an eye, Pumbakhayon moved to avoid the spear,
caught it, and then quickly tossed it back towards Aliguyon's way. In retaliation,
Aliguyon did the same. The two of them continued this battle for a long time, with
Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon just alternately throwing one spear towards each other
in the hopes of ending the life of the other.
In the three years of their non-stop fight, neither of them showed signs of weariness
and defeat, causing Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon to develop respect and admiration
for each other. With their realization came the end of their fight. Together, Aliguyon
and Pumbakhayon developed and drafted a peace treaty between the towns of
Hannanga and Daligdigan, which their people celebrated and readily agreed to.</a>

                            18. THE STORY OF THE OTHER NATIVITY  In the Holy Qu’ran’s version, there was no Joseph, nor a star. There was no gold,  or myrrh, or frankincense. Only Jesus and Mary and a palm tree.  There was a story that arrived on Philippine shores at least 356 years before the  arrival of the Spaniards to bring in the initial vestiges of the Christian belief system to the  Filipino people. The story was that of the birth of Iesa, the Islamic name of Jesus, as  described in the Holy Qu’ran. There was no manger. It was a birth with no magnificent star  in the night to lead no three magis, who bore no gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  There were no shepherds. There was no Joseph. But there was a tree, a palm tree, and  flowing water.  The story started with Maryam withdrawing, in seclusion from her family, to a place  facing east. There, the angel Jibrael appeared before her in the form of a man. Appalled,  she said that she sought refuge with God. The angel replied he was only a messenger of  God, sent to announce the gift of a righteous Son. But she could not possibly have a son,  she said, since no man had touched her and that she had not been unchaste. The angel  answered that God did this as a sign to mankind, and that this matter was already decreed.  And so, Maryam conceived the Child, and went to a far off place. When the  appointed time came, the pains of childbirth drove her beneath the shade of a date palm  tree, lamenting, “Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight.”  Then a cry from below came—unclear still whether it was the Child or Jibrael—telling  her not to grieve, and that the Lord had provided a stream of water under her. And if she  would just shake the tree, fresh ripe dates would fall upon her. She was told to eat and drink,  and if she would see a human being, she should say that she had vowed a fast unto the Most  Beneficent and not speak to anyone that day.  DIWATA-1  The baseline design of the 50-kilogram micro-satellite is assigned to Tohoku  University while Hokkaido University is tasked with the payload and thermal design.  The payload subsystem includes a high-precision telescope (HPT) with 3-meter  spatial resolution and bands R\G\B\NIR. The HPT will provide surface reflectance data  with its derived products which will be used mostly for damage extent determination during  disasters and calamities. It can also be used for imaging natural and cultural heritage sites.    The second payload is a space-borne multi-spectral imager (SMI) with liquid crystal  tunable filter (LCTF), which has an 80-meter spatial resolution. The LCTF allows for image  capture to be taken at 10 nanometer increments from 420nm – 650nm for the visible range  and 700nm – 1050nm for the near infrared region. Space products derived from this payload  can be used to determine the health and composition of the ocean, identify distribution and  magnitude of harmful algal blooms, and monitor coastal ecosystems.  With a spatial resolution of 7 kilometers, the wide field camera can used to complement  current weather forecasting capabilities. This sensor can potentially image cloud formations  and typhoons. Other subsystems included are command and data handling, attitude  determination and control, telemetry tracking and command, and power supply system.

efforts, his wife Alunsina, the virgin goddess from the east, accused him of having
an affair. They had a big fight, which caused Alunsina to run away. Tungkung
Langit did everything in his power to bring her back to no avail. He threw her
favorite comb into the sky to make the moon and her jewels became the stars.
However, Alunsina never came back and Tungkung Langit lived alone in the sky.
Every time it rains, it is said to be Tungkung Langit’s tears and that the thunder
is his voice, calling Alunsina back.
Text 2.__________ The Sultan Who Can’t Let Go Origin: Mindanao, Island of Sulu
Before the Spaniards landed in the Philippines, the island of Sulu was ruled over
by a Sultan named Barrabas. He was selfish and cruel. And like a neurotic beauty
queen, he was never seen in public without his crown. One day, Sultan Barrabas
was feasting on a massive banquet by himself when a beggar child appeared out
of nowhere and begged him for a bite to eat. At first, the sultan ignored the kid
and went back to gorging on his personal Spiral buffet. The child persisted in
begging for a bite, and even resorted to tugging at the sultan’s leg to get his
attention. In a fit of impatience, Sultan Barrabas grabbed a steaming bowl of soup
and dumped its contents over the child’s head. The beggar boy then abruptly
vanished, as the sultan collapsed to the floor. He died shortly after and was given
a funeral without much fanfare. Some months after a new sultan was crowned, a
tree took root on the previous ruler’s grave. On its branches hung fruits with
protrusions on the bottom that looked like tiny crowns, much like the one that
Sultan Barrabas never took off. It wasn’t long before people started calling the
small green orbs “barrabas” (which later evolved to bayabas), after the king whose
face and disposition was as sour as the fruits’ flesh.
Text 3. ___________ Huhud ni Aliguyon Origin: Luzon, Ifugao Province In a village
called Hannanga, a boy named Aliguyon was born. He was the son of the village's
leader, Amtalao, and his wife Dumulao. He was a brilliant and intelligent young man
who was always eager to learn and listen to the stories and teachings of his father.
Indeed, he learned many useful things. He knew how to do proper combat, and even
how to chant a few magic spells. Aliguyon showed promise and great leadership at an
early age, which earned the awe and amazement of his fellow villagers, even children.
During his teenage years, he decided to go into battle with his father's enemy,
Pangaiwan of the village of Daligdigan. However, his challenge was not personally
answered by Pangaiwan. Instead, he went face-to-face with Pangaiwan's fierce son,
Pumbakhayon. Pumbakhayon was just as skilled in the arts of war and magic as
Aliguyon. Upon battle, without hesitation, Aliguyon hurled a spear towards
Pumbakhayon. Without blinking an eye, Pumbakhayon moved to avoid the spear,
caught it, and then quickly tossed it back towards Aliguyon's way. In retaliation,
Aliguyon did the same. The two of them continued this battle for a long time, with
Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon just alternately throwing one spear towards each other
in the hopes of ending the life of the other.
In the three years of their non-stop fight, neither of them showed signs of weariness
and defeat, causing Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon to develop respect and admiration
for each other. With their realization came the end of their fight. Together, Aliguyon
and Pumbakhayon developed and drafted a peace treaty between the towns of
Hannanga and Daligdigan, which their people celebrated and readily agreed to.</h2><br />
