Lots of students fail classes. Some students fail because the work is too hard for them. Other times they may fail because they are lazy, and don't do any work. Another reason why students may fail is if they don't go to school. If you're not in class you may miss a lot. Many students fail classes every quarter. 4. A lot of students have been failing classes. These students wouldn't be failing classes if they studied more, asked questions, tried harder, and came in for extra help.

Learning Task 2. Identify the text structure of the following passages. Underline signal words and clues that helped you determine each structure.
_____________________1. Wild chimpanzees are rapidly disappearing. Some people are trying to solve this problem. Otherwise, chimpanzees may one day exist only in zoos. People are trying to save the rain forests and woodlands where
the chimps live from being cut down. It will take many people working together to solve this problem.
_____________________2. Chimpanzees and humans are alike in many ways. A baby chimp laughs when its mother tickles it. After chimpanzees fight, they kiss and make up. When one chimpanzee comforts another, it gives it a hug or
pat on the back. There are, of course, many ways that chimpanzees and humans are different. Chimpanzees are smaller and stronger than humans. An adult male chimpanzee stands three or four feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds. But a
chimpanzee can lift more weight than a man who is six feet tall.
_____________________3. Chimps live in groups and like each other a lot, but sometimes they fight. Because they don’t want to stay angry at each other after a fight, they make up by holding a hand out to the other and kissing. They show
they are sorry with pats and hugs. Then the anger goes away.
_____________________4. A chimpanzee’s body is made for climbing and swinging in the trees. First, it uses its long arms to reach a branch. Next, with its flexible hands and feet, it grabs and hooks on to the branch. Finally, it swings from that branch to another branch of tree.
_____________________5. It is fun to read about chimpanzees. All wild chimpanzees live in Africa. They live mostly in thick rain forests and in woodlands. There are two types, or species, of chimpanzees—the common chimpanzee and the bonobo, also known as the pygmy chimpanzee.</a>

1. Pop out (remove) the egg yolks to a small bowl and mash with a fork. Add mayonnaise, mustard powder, vinegar, salt and pepper and mix thoroughly. Fill the empty egg white shells with the mixture and sprinkle lightly
with paprika. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to one day before serving.
2. There are two popular sports played at Brgy. Canlubang: basketball and volleyball. Both take place inside of the gym at Sitio Asia I. Also, each sport has two teams of people. In basketball, however, the ball can be played off of the
floor, and in volleyball, the ball cannot touch the floor or it is out of play. Basketball and volleyball are popular sports at Canlubang.
3. Lots of students fail classes. Some students fail because the work is too hard for them. Other times they may fail because they are lazy, and don’t do any work. Another reason why students may fail is if they don’t go to school. If
you’re not in class you may miss a lot. Many students fail classes every quarter.
4. A lot of students have been failing classes. These students wouldn’t be failing classes if they studied more, asked questions, tried harder, and came in for extra help. Even though a lot of students fail classes, they have many
options if they want to pass.
5. Devers experienced the highlight of any sprinter’s career, as she stood on the huge platform in the giant stadium and received an Olympic gold medal. Eighteen months earlier she wasn’t thinking about running. She was
hoping that she would be able to walk again. Just four years earlier, in the summer of 1988, as Devers was training for the Olympic Games, to be held in Seoul, South Korea, she began to feel very tired all the time and failed to make
the Olympic finals.
Learning Task 2. Identify the text structure of the following passages. Underline signal words and clues that helped you determine each structure.
_____________________1. Wild chimpanzees are rapidly disappearing. Some people are trying to solve this problem. Otherwise, chimpanzees may one day exist only in zoos. People are trying to save the rain forests and woodlands where
the chimps live from being cut down. It will take many people working together to solve this problem.
_____________________2. Chimpanzees and humans are alike in many ways. A baby chimp laughs when its mother tickles it. After chimpanzees fight, they kiss and make up. When one chimpanzee comforts another, it gives it a hug or
pat on the back. There are, of course, many ways that chimpanzees and humans are different. Chimpanzees are smaller and stronger than humans. An adult male chimpanzee stands three or four feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds. But a
chimpanzee can lift more weight than a man who is six feet tall.
_____________________3. Chimps live in groups and like each other a lot, but sometimes they fight. Because they don’t want to stay angry at each other after a fight, they make up by holding a hand out to the other and kissing. They show
they are sorry with pats and hugs. Then the anger goes away.
_____________________4. A chimpanzee’s body is made for climbing and swinging in the trees. First, it uses its long arms to reach a branch. Next, with its flexible hands and feet, it grabs and hooks on to the branch. Finally, it swings from that branch to another branch of tree.
_____________________5. It is fun to read about chimpanzees. All wild chimpanzees live in Africa. They live mostly in thick rain forests and in woodlands. There are two types, or species, of chimpanzees—the common chimpanzee and the bonobo, also known as the pygmy chimpanzee.</a>

1. Pop out (remove) the egg yolks to a small bowl and mash with a fork. Add mayonnaise, mustard powder, vinegar, salt and pepper and mix thoroughly. Fill the empty egg white shells with the mixture and sprinkle lightly
with paprika. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to one day before serving.
2. There are two popular sports played at Brgy. Canlubang: basketball and volleyball. Both take place inside of the gym at Sitio Asia I. Also, each sport has two teams of people. In basketball, however, the ball can be played off of the
floor, and in volleyball, the ball cannot touch the floor or it is out of play. Basketball and volleyball are popular sports at Canlubang.
3. Lots of students fail classes. Some students fail because the work is too hard for them. Other times they may fail because they are lazy, and don’t do any work. Another reason why students may fail is if they don’t go to school. If
you’re not in class you may miss a lot. Many students fail classes every quarter.
4. A lot of students have been failing classes. These students wouldn’t be failing classes if they studied more, asked questions, tried harder, and came in for extra help. Even though a lot of students fail classes, they have many
options if they want to pass.
5. Devers experienced the highlight of any sprinter’s career, as she stood on the huge platform in the giant stadium and received an Olympic gold medal. Eighteen months earlier she wasn’t thinking about running. She was
hoping that she would be able to walk again. Just four years earlier, in the summer of 1988, as Devers was training for the Olympic Games, to be held in Seoul, South Korea, she began to feel very tired all the time and failed to make
the Olympic finals.
Learning Task 2. Identify the text structure of the following passages. Underline signal words and clues that helped you determine each structure.
_____________________1. Wild chimpanzees are rapidly disappearing. Some people are trying to solve this problem. Otherwise, chimpanzees may one day exist only in zoos. People are trying to save the rain forests and woodlands where
the chimps live from being cut down. It will take many people working together to solve this problem.
_____________________2. Chimpanzees and humans are alike in many ways. A baby chimp laughs when its mother tickles it. After chimpanzees fight, they kiss and make up. When one chimpanzee comforts another, it gives it a hug or
pat on the back. There are, of course, many ways that chimpanzees and humans are different. Chimpanzees are smaller and stronger than humans. An adult male chimpanzee stands three or four feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds. But a
chimpanzee can lift more weight than a man who is six feet tall.
_____________________3. Chimps live in groups and like each other a lot, but sometimes they fight. Because they don’t want to stay angry at each other after a fight, they make up by holding a hand out to the other and kissing. They show
they are sorry with pats and hugs. Then the anger goes away.
_____________________4. A chimpanzee’s body is made for climbing and swinging in the trees. First, it uses its long arms to reach a branch. Next, with its flexible hands and feet, it grabs and hooks on to the branch. Finally, it swings from that branch to another branch of tree.
_____________________5. It is fun to read about chimpanzees. All wild chimpanzees live in Africa. They live mostly in thick rain forests and in woodlands. There are two types, or species, of chimpanzees—the common chimpanzee and the bonobo, also known as the pygmy chimpanzee.</h2><br />
