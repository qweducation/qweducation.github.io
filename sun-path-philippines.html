The sun is directed to the southern hemisphere only. B. The sun is somehow tilted to both Northern and Southern hemisphere. C. Seasons change because the earth is stationary directing its rays to northern hemisphere always D. Seasons change because direct rays of the sun shift from one hemisphere to the other as the earth goes around the sun 5. Which part of the earth experiences summer in December and colder in June? A. Northern hemisphere since Sun is tilted towards it on June and December B. Northern hemisphere because it receives direct rays from the sun in December and lesser in June C.

_____11. The water cycle is the path that all water follows as it moves around our planet. Heat from the sun causes water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and streams. Evaporation occurs when water on Earth’s surface turns into water vapor in our atmosphere. Warm water rises through Earth’s atmosphere. As the water vapor rises higher and higher, the cool air of the atmosphere causes the water vapor to turn back into water creating clouds. This process 
is called condensation. When a cloud becomes full of liquid water, it falls from the sky as rain – also known as precipitation. Rain then fill the lakes and streams, and the process starts all over again. 
_____12. Typhoons and tropical Storms bring wind and rain. They may be sometime very strong that can destroy properties. Being prepared is essential to survival. First, listen to the radio or TV for information and keep your weather radio handy (if available). Next, secure your home. Close storm shutters and secure outdoor objects or bring them indoors. Then, turn off utilities if instructed to do so. Lastly, avoid using the phone, except for serious emergencies. 
_____13. Making lemonade is just an easy thing to do. First, slice the lemon in half and squeeze it to get the juice of it. Next, put some water in a pitcher and add the lemon juice to the water. Then, add some sugar and stir it. Finally, pour it in a cup and add a straw if you wish to use it. Now, enjoy drinking your lemonade juice. 
_____14. Frogs undergo some stages before they become adult frogs. First, the mother frog lays her eggs in the water. This is called frog spawn. Next, the eggs hatch into tiny tadpoles. During this time, they grow gills to help them breathe in water. Then, they grow two hind legs. Later, they grow two front legs. Afterwards, the tadpole looks like a frog but it has a tail. This is called a froglet. Finally, the froglet loose its tail. Now, It’s a frog. 
_____15. Some objects may sink and other just float. It depends on the density of the object. An object is made of substances that are themselves made up of molecules. Density is a measure of both how massive those molecules are, and how closely packed together they are. If the object's total density is greater than that of water, it sinks, but if it is less, it floats. Human activity is the main cause of climate change. People burn fossil fuels and convert land from forests to agriculture. Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. It is called a greenhouse gas because it produces a “greenhouse effect”.

                            7. Learning Task 1. Read each item carefully and encircle the letter of correct answer. 1. Earth's seasons are caused by which of the following? A. the varying amount of sunspot activity B. the rotation of the Earth during a 24-hour day C. the earth's orbit about the Sun as an ellipse rather than a circle D. the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation relative to the path as Earth revolves around the Sun 2. What effect does the tilting of the earth have? A. When the Earth is tilted away from the sun, we have day. B. When the earth is tilted away from the sun we have night. C. It changes the angle that the sun strikes the earth in different land areas. D. It causes the earth to be farther away from the sun at different times of the year. 3. When it is summer in southern hemisphere, which of the following best describes the tilting of the Earth in the northern hemisphere? A. towards the sun C. towards or away from the sun B. away from the sun D. neither toward or away from the moon 4. Why do seasons change in the Philippines? A. The sun is directed to the southern hemisphere only. B. The sun is somehow tilted to both Northern and Southern hemisphere. C. Seasons change because the earth is stationary directing its rays to northern hemisphere always D. Seasons change because direct rays of the sun shift from one hemisphere to the other as the earth goes around the sun 5. Which part of the earth experiences summer in December and colder in June? A. Northern hemisphere since Sun is tilted towards it on June and December B. Northern hemisphere because it receives direct rays from the sun in December and lesser in June C. Southern hemisphere because it receives direct rays from the sun in December and lesser solar energy in June D. Both southern and northern hemisphere because they receive equal rays directed from the sun in December and June 6. This natural phenomenon starts during the summer months in the northern hemisphere, when the Asian continent becomes warmer than the surrounding seas. A.

_____11. The water cycle is the path that all water follows as it moves around our planet. Heat from the sun causes water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and streams. Evaporation occurs when water on Earth’s surface turns into water vapor in our atmosphere. Warm water rises through Earth’s atmosphere. As the water vapor rises higher and higher, the cool air of the atmosphere causes the water vapor to turn back into water creating clouds. This process 
is called condensation. When a cloud becomes full of liquid water, it falls from the sky as rain – also known as precipitation. Rain then fill the lakes and streams, and the process starts all over again. 
_____12. Typhoons and tropical Storms bring wind and rain. They may be sometime very strong that can destroy properties. Being prepared is essential to survival. First, listen to the radio or TV for information and keep your weather radio handy (if available). Next, secure your home. Close storm shutters and secure outdoor objects or bring them indoors. Then, turn off utilities if instructed to do so. Lastly, avoid using the phone, except for serious emergencies. 
_____13. Making lemonade is just an easy thing to do. First, slice the lemon in half and squeeze it to get the juice of it. Next, put some water in a pitcher and add the lemon juice to the water. Then, add some sugar and stir it. Finally, pour it in a cup and add a straw if you wish to use it. Now, enjoy drinking your lemonade juice. 
_____14. Frogs undergo some stages before they become adult frogs. First, the mother frog lays her eggs in the water. This is called frog spawn. Next, the eggs hatch into tiny tadpoles. During this time, they grow gills to help them breathe in water. Then, they grow two hind legs. Later, they grow two front legs. Afterwards, the tadpole looks like a frog but it has a tail. This is called a froglet. Finally, the froglet loose its tail. Now, It’s a frog. 
_____15. Some objects may sink and other just float. It depends on the density of the object. An object is made of substances that are themselves made up of molecules. Density is a measure of both how massive those molecules are, and how closely packed together they are. If the object's total density is greater than that of water, it sinks, but if it is less, it floats. Human activity is the main cause of climate change. People burn fossil fuels and convert land from forests to agriculture. Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. It is called a greenhouse gas because it produces a “greenhouse effect”.
