Weathering and erosion are very slow processes. Geologists believe the Colorado River has been flowing through the Grand Canyon for at least 17 million years, and it has been gradually shaping the canyon this entire time. The flowing water of the river and its tributaries has carved away at the rock of the Colorado Plateau, creating the amazing sight that is seen nowadays.2. Excessive use of gadgets negatively affects children's health. For instance, prolonged exposure to the screen causes eye strain. Children experience dry, itchy and irritated eyes when they spend hours using the computer, tablet or cellular phone. Too much use of gadgets also changes sleeping patterns of kids who play games or surf the internet late into the night. Studies reveal that exposure to tech gadgets changes brain activity that disturb sleep patterns. Reports also show that too much use of gadgets cause obesity. Many children do not wish to go out anymore because they enjoy playing games in their devices. The problem is that they do engage in physical activities anymore, so they end up obese. With these negative effects, education experts advise parents to regulate or control gadget use.3. Sun exposure is linked to skin cancer. This is the most common type of cancer in the world. It's best to limit your time spent in the sun. Be sure to wear protective clothing and hats when you are outside. Use sunscreen year-round on exposed skin, like your face and hands. It protects your skin and helps prevent skin cancer. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays. It should be at least an SPF 15. Do not sunbathe or use tanning booths.4. The cats' behavior of cleaning their body with their tongue serves several purposes: It helps cats to tone down their scent so they can avoid predators, it cools them down, it promotes blood flow, and it distributes natural oils evenly around their coat, allowing them to stay warm and dry. Grooming also serves as a sign of affection between two cats, and it's thought that saliva contains enzymes that serve as a natural antibiotic for wounds.5. Maintaining space between yourself and others is a best practice and is one of the best tools to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus. People can spread the virus without being sick or knowing they are sick, so it is important to maintain social distance from others whenever possible. Physical distancing is required on USM's main campus and in satellite locations to limit exposure to the COVID-19 virus and slow its spread.​</a>

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable.

The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5.

                            5. Read the selections carefully and identify the general statement and specific details. Then, apply any of the formats in citing textual evidence.1. Weathering and erosion are very slow processes. Geologists believe the Colorado River has been flowing through the Grand Canyon for at least 17 million years, and it has been gradually shaping the canyon this entire time. The flowing water of the river and its tributaries has carved away at the rock of the Colorado Plateau, creating the amazing sight that is seen nowadays.2. Excessive use of gadgets negatively affects children's health. For instance, prolonged exposure to the screen causes eye strain. Children experience dry, itchy and irritated eyes when they spend hours using the computer, tablet or cellular phone. Too much use of gadgets also changes sleeping patterns of kids who play games or surf the internet late into the night. Studies reveal that exposure to tech gadgets changes brain activity that disturb sleep patterns. Reports also show that too much use of gadgets cause obesity. Many children do not wish to go out anymore because they enjoy playing games in their devices. The problem is that they do engage in physical activities anymore, so they end up obese. With these negative effects, education experts advise parents to regulate or control gadget use.3. Sun exposure is linked to skin cancer. This is the most common type of cancer in the world. It's best to limit your time spent in the sun. Be sure to wear protective clothing and hats when you are outside. Use sunscreen year-round on exposed skin, like your face and hands. It protects your skin and helps prevent skin cancer. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays. It should be at least an SPF 15. Do not sunbathe or use tanning booths.4. The cats' behavior of cleaning their body with their tongue serves several purposes: It helps cats to tone down their scent so they can avoid predators, it cools them down, it promotes blood flow, and it distributes natural oils evenly around their coat, allowing them to stay warm and dry. Grooming also serves as a sign of affection between two cats, and it's thought that saliva contains enzymes that serve as a natural antibiotic for wounds.5. Maintaining space between yourself and others is a best practice and is one of the best tools to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus. People can spread the virus without being sick or knowing they are sick, so it is important to maintain social distance from others whenever possible. Physical distancing is required on USM's main campus and in satellite locations to limit exposure to the COVID-19 virus and slow its spread.​</h2><br />

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3.

His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.
