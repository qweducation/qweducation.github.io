A pathway that electricity flows in. It has a load, wire, and a puppy.B. A pathway that protons flow in. It has a load, wire, and a power source.C. A pathway that electricity flows in. It has a resistor, wire, and a power source.D. A pathway that electricity flows in. It has a load and wire.7. Electron flow is most often seen in introductory textbooks and in the writings of professionalscientists, especially solid-state physicists who are concerned with the actual motion of electronsin substances. Why is it different from electric engineers who view the flow in the conventionalway?A. These preferences are cultural, in the sense that certain groups of people have found itadvantageous to envision electric current motion in certain ways.B. They just feel like fighting with each other to see who has better resultsC. Their preferences depend on the achievement of the last generation of scientists and engineerswhich resulted in discussions.D. None of the above.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Rapping (also rhyming, spitting,[1] emceeing[2] or MCing[2][3]) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates "rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular",[4] which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backing beat or musical accompaniment.[4] The components of rap include "content" (what is being said), "flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone).[5] Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed off time to musical accompaniment.[6] Rap being a primary ingredient of hip hop music, it is commonly associated with that genre in particular; however, the origins of rap predate hip-hop culture by many years.
</p><p>
</p><p>Precursors to modern rap include the West African griot tradition,[7] certain vocal styles of blues,[8] jazz,[9] 1960s African-American poetry[10] and Sprechgesang. The modern use of rap in popular music originated in the Bronx, New York City in the 1970s, alongside the hip hop genre and cultural movement.[11] Rapping developed from the role of master of ceremonies (MC) at parties within the scene. They would encourage and entertain guests between DJ sets, which evolved into longer performances.
