                                            IntroductionLithosphere consists of crust and the upper portion of the mantle. There are two types of crust,the continental crust and the oceanic crust. The continental crust is thicker but less dense than theoceanic crust. Because of the difference in density, continental crust floats higher than the oceanic crust.The Earth is divided into segments called plates.There are seven relatively large plates and a number of smaller ones, including the Philippine plate.The plates move very slowly but constantly, and this movement is called tectonics; thus the theory ofmoving lithospheric plates is called plate tectonics. Earthquake is a vibration of the Earth due to therapid release of energy and it is the consequences of moving crustal plates which is crucial in studyingplate tectonics.Learning Competency1.

Write numbers 1-6, number 1 for the first event and so on. _41. With the exception of Palawan, Mindoro and Romblon, most of the Philippine islands are considered to have been parts of island arcs formed at the southern edge of the Philippine Sea plate millions of years ago._42. The first Philippine Island showed up about 60 million years ago. It is the island of Mindoro and Palawan which is very near the island of present-day Taiwan. _43.As part of the Philippine Sea plate, the islands moved northward as the plate rotated clockwise. These roving islands, known as the Philippine Mobile Belt, eventually collided with the Sundaland. The collision resulted, among others, in a series of subdaround Philippine archipelago. _44. On the eastern frontier, are the subductions along East Luzon trough and Philippine trench. These westward subductions resulted in the formations of the eastern island arcs of Northern Sierra Madre, Southern Sierra Madre-Polillo-Catanduanes and the East Philippine arc. In time, some of these arcs merged to-gether forming big islands like Luzon and Mindanao. _45. The Luzon arc is a complex belt of volcanoes extending from the Coastal Range of southeastern Taiwan through the volcanic islands north of Luzon, the Luzon Central Cordillera, and the Western Luzon arc, ending at Marinduque Island. The arc has been active since the Oligocene period to the present. _46. On the western border, are the subductions along trenches of Manila, Negros, Sulu and Celebes where the plates of the South China Sea, Sulu Sea and Celebes Sea are subducting beneath the Philippine Sea plate. These eastward subductions resulted in the emergence of the island arcs of Luzon, Negros, Sulu- Zamboanga and Cotabato.​</a>

                            6. IntroductionLithosphere consists of crust and the upper portion of the mantle. There are two types of crust,the continental crust and the oceanic crust. The continental crust is thicker but less dense than theoceanic crust. Because of the difference in density, continental crust floats higher than the oceanic crust.The Earth is divided into segments called plates.There are seven relatively large plates and a number of smaller ones, including the Philippine plate.The plates move very slowly but constantly, and this movement is called tectonics; thus the theory ofmoving lithospheric plates is called plate tectonics. Earthquake is a vibration of the Earth due to therapid release of energy and it is the consequences of moving crustal plates which is crucial in studyingplate tectonics.Learning Competency1.

Write numbers 1-6, number 1 for the first event and so on. _41. With the exception of Palawan, Mindoro and Romblon, most of the Philippine islands are considered to have been parts of island arcs formed at the southern edge of the Philippine Sea plate millions of years ago._42. The first Philippine Island showed up about 60 million years ago. It is the island of Mindoro and Palawan which is very near the island of present-day Taiwan. _43.As part of the Philippine Sea plate, the islands moved northward as the plate rotated clockwise. These roving islands, known as the Philippine Mobile Belt, eventually collided with the Sundaland. The collision resulted, among others, in a series of subdaround Philippine archipelago. _44. On the eastern frontier, are the subductions along East Luzon trough and Philippine trench. These westward subductions resulted in the formations of the eastern island arcs of Northern Sierra Madre, Southern Sierra Madre-Polillo-Catanduanes and the East Philippine arc. In time, some of these arcs merged to-gether forming big islands like Luzon and Mindanao. _45. The Luzon arc is a complex belt of volcanoes extending from the Coastal Range of southeastern Taiwan through the volcanic islands north of Luzon, the Luzon Central Cordillera, and the Western Luzon arc, ending at Marinduque Island. The arc has been active since the Oligocene period to the present. _46. On the western border, are the subductions along trenches of Manila, Negros, Sulu and Celebes where the plates of the South China Sea, Sulu Sea and Celebes Sea are subducting beneath the Philippine Sea plate. These eastward subductions resulted in the emergence of the island arcs of Luzon, Negros, Sulu- Zamboanga and Cotabato.​</h2><br />

Volcanic island arc is a chain of volcanoes position in an arc shape.2. The collision of two plates, with one of the plates diving under the ocean will occur at theOceanic - Oceanic Convergent plate boundary.3. Majority of the islands in the Philippine Archipelago are considered as part of the Philippinesmobile belt.4. The Southern edge of the Philippines sea plates are considered as part of island arcs.5. In the Philippines, the highland sections of the Sundaland block of the Eurasian plate includesPalawan, Mindoro and Zamboanga Peninsula.6. The converging oceanic plates will cause formation of trenches and eventually become thesources of an earthquake.7. Underwater earthquakes, especially the stronger ones, can generate Tsunami8. Tsunami is a Japanese term for wave. It is a series of ocean waves with very longwavelengths.9. The leading edge of the subducted plate will eventually reach the mantle causing it to melt andturn into magma.10. The molten material will rise to the surface creating a volcanic island arc parallel to the trench.11. Pandemic is a theory which suggest that Earth's crust is made up of plates that interact invarious ways, thus producing earthquakes, mountains, and volcanoes.12. Developmental volcanic arc are mountains formed as part of igneous activity associated withsubduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath a continent.13. Centennial crust is the thick part of the Earth's crust, not located under the ocean.14. Trench Crust is the thin part of the Earth's crust located under the ocean.15. The rigid sections of the lithosphere that move as a unit is called plateau.​</h2><br />
