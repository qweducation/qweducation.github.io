                            3. The socio-economic condition of Spain and Philippines during Rizal’s time. </h2><br />
                        <p>Spain:</p><p></p><p>During the time of Dr. Jose Rizal, Spain was still a strong colonial power and its economy was largely dependent on its growing merchant marine and naval forces and the exploitation of its colonies throughout the world. Economic development was slow, with a few small industries and a mostly agrarian economy. Its resources were limited, and it was vulnerable to other international powers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Philippines:</p><p></p><p>The Philippines during Rizal's time was a Spanish colony, and the majority of its people were enslaved labourers. Poverty and exploitation were rampant. Education was virtually non-existent and limited to religious instruction. Large haciendas monopolized land and wealth, and income inequality was rampant. Many Filipinos resorted to subsistence farming and fishing. A growing working class sprang up, mostly composed of urban workers who laboured as day labourers in low-paying jobs in ports, plantations and factories. Filipino intellectuals, such as Dr. Jose Rizal, were at the forefront of a growing nationalist movement that sought reforms to liberate the Philippines from Spanish rule.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The proclamation of the Philippine independence from Spain was written by Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, who was a lawyer and member of the revolutionary movement known as the Katipunan. However, it is important to note that the proclamation was not just the work of one person, but rather a collective effort of various individuals who fought for Philippine independence.</p><p></p><p>2.The main reasons behind the proclamation of Philippine independence in 1898 were the desire of the Filipino people to be free from Spanish colonial rule, the influence of the ideals of the Enlightenment and the American Revolution, and the support of other nations, such as the United States, who were interested in expanding their influence in Asia.</p><p></p><p>3.The proclamation of the Philippine independence reflects the struggle of the Filipino people for self-determination and national sovereignty.

                            8. I spent 100 pts on this. Summarized the whole story of the Philippines in the time of Spain, Americans, and Japanese WARNING: NONSENSE ANSWER REPORT</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippines has a long and complex history that includes colonization by Spain, occupation by the United States, and a brief period of Japanese control during World War II.</p><p>During the Spanish colonization, which began in 1521, the Philippines were ruled by a series of Spanish governors, who enforced Spanish culture and religion. This period was marked by resistance from indigenous Filipinos, including the 1896 revolution led by Andres Bonifacio and the eventual declaration of independence on June 12, 1898.</p><p>However, the Philippines was not yet truly independent, as it was immediately occupied by the United States in 1898, as part of the aftermath of the Spanish-American War. The US established a civil government and introduced modern infrastructure, education, and a democratic system of governance. Despite these developments, there was also resistance to American rule, including the Philippine-American War, which lasted from 1899 to 1902.</p><p>The Philippines remained a US colony until 1946, with the exception of the Japanese occupation during World War II, which lasted from 1942 to 1945. During this period, Filipinos suffered greatly, with widespread violence, forced labor, and famine. However, Filipino resistance fighters, such as the Hukbalahap guerrillas, played a significant role in the liberation of the Philippines from Japanese control.</p><p>After World War II, the Philippines became an independent nation, with its own constitution and democratic government. The country has since undergone many changes and challenges, including political unrest, economic development, and natural disasters, but has remained a resilient and diverse nation in Southeast Asia.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>The history of the Philippines from 1565 to 1898, also called the Spanish Era, is the period during which the Philippine Islands were ruled as the Captaincy General of the Philippines within the Spanish East Indies, initially under the Kingdom of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, based in Mexico City, until the independence of Mexico from Spain in 1821. This resulted in direct Spanish control during a period of governmental instability there. The Philippines was under direct royal governance from 1821 to 1898. The first documented European contact with the Philippines was made in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan in his circumnavigation expedition, during which he was killed in the Battle of Mactan. Forty-four years later, a Spanish expedition led by Miguel López de Legazpi left modern Mexico and began the Spanish conquest of the Philippines. Legazpi's expedition arrived in the Philippines in 1565, during the reign of Philip II of Spain, whose name has remained attached to the country and the Spanish colonial period ended with the defeat of Spain by the United States in the Spanish–American War, which marked the beginning of the American colonial era of Philippine history. American settlement in the Philippines began during the Spanish colonial period. The period of American colonialization of the Philippines was 48 years. It began with the cession of the Philippines to the U.S. by Spain in 1898 and lasted until the U.S. recognition of Philippine independence in 1946. After independence in 1946, many Americans chose to remain in the Philippines while maintaining relations with relatives in the US. Most of them were professionals, but missionaries continued to settle the country. In 2015, the U.S. State Department estimated 2016 that more than 220,000 U.S. citizens lived in the Philippines and more than 650,000 visited per year, with a significant mixed population of Amerasians and descendants from the colonial era as well. During the Spanish- American War, the United States invaded the Philippines, which was then governed by Spain as the Spanish East Indies. During that war, Philippine revolutionaries declared independence. Wanting to maintain a stronghold over the island nation as a stepping stone to Japan and continental Asia, the United States maintained the authority over the archipelago and the Philippine–American War ensued. America then held the Philippines until granting complete independence on July 4, 1946. On December 8, 1941, Japan launched an attack on the Commonwealth of the Philippines, ten hours after their attack on Pearl Harbor. The Philippines at this time was a semi-independent commonwealth government under the colonial rule of the United States of America. Filipino and American soldiers were defeated a the Battle of Bataan and the Battle of Corregidor in April 1942. The Japanese occupation of the Philippines occurred between 1942 and 1945 during WWII. Filipinos staged guerrilla resistance against the Japanese until 1945. The Philippines was liberated from Japanese control by Allied forces in 1944. The Philippines was granted full independence by the United States in 1946. </p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            23. The socio-economic condition of Spain and Philippines during Rizal’s time. Essay</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the Middle of the 19th century, Spanish colonization of the Philippines had a significant impact on the socio-economic conditions of both nations. In Spain and its colonies, Spanish commerce and industry flourished, fueled by the exploitation of resources from the colonies and a lack of taxation on Spanish income. For the Philippines, however, the colonial system brought about different results.</p><p></p><p>Spain's economy was robust during the era of Rizal. The country had recovered from previous financial turmoil and was experiencing a period of economic growth, making it one of the most prosperous countries in Europe. Industrialization and modern technology had accelerated, mainly due to the exploitation of resources in the colonies and the lack of taxation on Spanish income. Spanish capitalists had access to great wealth due to their control of the trading ports, especially in the Philippines. As a consequence of this wealth, the Spanish monarchy was able to invest in public services and public works in the colonies and in their homeland, increasing the living standards of the Spanish nations.</p><p></p><p>The Philippines, on the other hand, had a far different experience under Spanish rule. The country was subject to high taxation and limited industrial development. The agricultural sector suffered in particular with the country supplying mainly sugar and other raw materials to Spain rather than its own people. Furthermore, the country was drained by resource exploitation, principally of its people, who were forced to provide cheap labor to the Spanish. Thus, the economic and social inequalities between them and the Spaniards in the Philippines further widened leading to the outcry of the middle and lower classes.</p><p></p><p>During the time of Dr. José Rizal, the economic and social disparities between Spain and the Philippines could not have been more pronounced. The people of the Philippines experienced exploitation and poverty, while the people of Spain enjoyed great wealth and prosperity. Consequently, these disparate socio-economic conditions led to discontent among the people of the Philippines and inspired them to take action, ultimately laying the groundwork for the Philippine Revolution.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Spanish colonial period in the Philippines was the period during which the Philippines were part of the Spanish Empire as the Captaincy General of the Philippines from 1565 to 1898. The islands were part of the larger Spanish East Indies. Forty-four years after Ferdinand Magellan discovered the Philippines and died in the Battle of Mactan in 1521, the Spanish explored and colonized the islands, starting with the founding of Cebu by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi in 1565. Manila was made the capital of the Philippines in 1571. This was the time of the reign of King Philip II of Spain, whose name has remained attached to the country. The Spanish colonial period ended with the Philippine Revolution and Spanish-American War in 1898, which marked the beginning of the American colonization of the Philippines.</p><br />
