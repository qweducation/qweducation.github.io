Instead, take a closer look.New research shows that overqualified workers tend to perform better than other employees, and they don’t quit any sooner. Furthermore, a simple managerial tactic empowerment can mitigate any dissatisfaction they may feel.The prejudice against too-good employees is pervasive. Companies tend to prefer an applicant who is a perfect fit over someone who brings more intelligence, education, or experience than needed. On the surface, this bias makes sense: Studies have consistently shown that employees who consider themselves overqualified exhibiting her levels of discontent.But even before the economic downturn, a surplus of overqualified candidates was a global problem, particularly in developing economies, where rising education levels are giving workers more skills that are needed to supply the growing service sectors. If managers can get beyond the conventional wisdom, the growing pool of too-good applicants is a great opportunity.Berrin Erdogan and Talya N. Bauer of Portland State University in Oregon found that overqualified workers’ feelings of dissatisfaction can be dissipated by giving them autonomy in decision making. At stores where employees didn’t feel empowered, over-educated workers expressed greater dissatisfaction than their colleagues did and were more likely to state an intention to quit.

It has over 8,000 direct-hired employees who stayed for an average of 12 years in the company due to better staffing approach and retention programs. Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc. in Pampanga market, which included 12 different stores, required instantaneous provisional workers to convene their staffing demands due to natural hazards and risks such as typhoon and earthquakes that happened in Pampanga in the summer of 2019. Previously, the company had never outsourced a temporary recruitment agency domestically for their staffing motives, however due to the exigency, the company executives decided to tie up with human resource staffing agencies. High number of competent workers needed is the main reason of the decision of company to come up in partnering with staffing firms to acquire the lack of workforce they had locally in their Human Resource department. The competency, educational attainment, and job experience of the needed employees were an extensive range which requires various recruitment personnel to handle each. The following job vacancies include purchasing, sales, warehouse managers, general labours and clerical employees. Time frame of two weeks was set up to deliver a total of 175 employees in the first month. Questions: 1. Describe the main challenge/s of Deca MaGarne Da Construction Inc.?​</h2><br />
