                                            Let's reform the K-12 program Filipino students face a serious gap in leaming as a result of the world's longest community lockdown that put them out of physical classrooms for nearly two years. What has been trumpeted as a savior for poor families which cannot afford to complete four years of college education turned out to be a failure-inadequately and poorly programmed Waste of money and time for parents and students for the two years of delay Adding woes was the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in two more years of stunted education. The Philippines, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank, had the longest pandemic-induced school closures among the 122 countries covered, breaking the 70-week mark since the pandemic began in 2020. Prolonged school closures, the Word Bank added, would aggravate the leaming gap and result in decreased productivity and earnings by the time the students join the workforce. And then there's the inutile K-12 program that only added woes to parents scrambling for resources to sustain their children's education. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has issued a directive to have a thorough review of the K-12 program. The late president Benigno Aquino III signed the K-12 law as his administration's legacy in education, despite pleas from teachers, parents, and other stakeholders to delay its implementation. What now with K-12? Like-minded educators are proposing that K-12 be optional, especially for industries that can accommodate short-course holders. Processing Questions: 1. What is the news all about? 2. What is your reaction about the news? 3. Do you agree or disagree with what the news stated?​</a>

And Secretary Duque will expound more on that. The rest ofthe country will be placed under modified general community quarantine.

In other areas, it will be again on a piecemeal basis depending on the viability of theplace to meet the challenges of COVID.

But we are expecting the 300,000 somethingthat Secretary Bello has communicated to us and that would be also a problem again. Butthis time, we should know what to do.

TOPIC: WHY FILIPINOS NEED TO STAY AT HOME UNTIL DECEMBER (OR EVEN LONGER) Think of your favorite zombie movie or video game. How do people survive in those fictional situations? They avoid contact with the infected usually by quarantining themselves. That's exactly what isolation does in our present situation. Some people think this is all an overreaction. We've seen plenty of comments on Android Authority articles from readers who think that there's no reason for self-isolation during this pandemic. We've even seen people call this whole thing a hoax. I think we need to stay at home until December (or even longer) because COVID-19 spreads very easily, asymptomatic persons do exist, and there is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19 yet.

If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2. Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3. “100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4. 90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5. Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6. Catharsis in Nostalgia by Abigail Eclavea7. It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardly present in mainstream cinema. “I love that there’s more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirable characters and the 2000’s vibes.”​</a>

                            6. Let's reform the K-12 program Filipino students face a serious gap in leaming as a result of the world's longest community lockdown that put them out of physical classrooms for nearly two years. What has been trumpeted as a savior for poor families which cannot afford to complete four years of college education turned out to be a failure-inadequately and poorly programmed Waste of money and time for parents and students for the two years of delay Adding woes was the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in two more years of stunted education. The Philippines, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank, had the longest pandemic-induced school closures among the 122 countries covered, breaking the 70-week mark since the pandemic began in 2020. Prolonged school closures, the Word Bank added, would aggravate the leaming gap and result in decreased productivity and earnings by the time the students join the workforce. And then there's the inutile K-12 program that only added woes to parents scrambling for resources to sustain their children's education. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has issued a directive to have a thorough review of the K-12 program. The late president Benigno Aquino III signed the K-12 law as his administration's legacy in education, despite pleas from teachers, parents, and other stakeholders to delay its implementation. What now with K-12? Like-minded educators are proposing that K-12 be optional, especially for industries that can accommodate short-course holders. Processing Questions: 1. What is the news all about? 2. What is your reaction about the news? 3. Do you agree or disagree with what the news stated?​</h2><br />

The news is about the failure of the K-12 program in the Philippines, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and the prolonged school closures that resulted in a significant learning gap among students.

Standards: Your persuasive essay needs to be accomplished. TOPIC: WHY FILIPINOS NEED TO STAY AT HOME UNTIL DECEMBER (OR EVEN LONGER) Think of your favorite zombie movie or video game. How do people survive in those fictional situations? They avoid contact with the infected usually by quarantining themselves. That's exactly what isolation does in our present situation. Some people think this is all an overreaction. We've seen plenty of comments on Android Authority articles from readers who think that there's no reason for self-isolation during this pandemic. We've even seen people call this whole thing a hoax. I think we need to stay at home until December (or even longer) because COVID-19 spreads very easily, asymptomatic persons do exist, and there is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19 yet. What will the first body paragraph be about? What will the second body paragraph be about? What will the third body paragraph be about? What will be the concluding paragraph? 4 | ENGLISH 10 FOURTH QUARTER WEEK 7​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>First body paragraph: The first body paragraph will likely provide evidence and arguments supporting the statement that COVID-19 spreads very easily. It may discuss the high transmission rate of the virus, the importance of social distancing measures, and examples of how the virus has spread rapidly in different regions.</p><p></p><p>Second body paragraph: The second body paragraph will focus on the existence of asymptomatic individuals and their role in the spread of COVID-19. It may discuss studies and cases that have demonstrated how asymptomatic carriers can unknowingly transmit the virus to others, emphasizing the need for caution and preventive measures even in the absence of apparent symptoms.</p><p></p><p>Third body paragraph: The third body paragraph will address the absence of a cure or vaccine for COVID-19. It may discuss the challenges in developing a vaccine, the importance of mitigating the spread through isolation and preventive measures until a cure or effective vaccine becomes available, and the potential consequences of lifting restrictions prematurely.</p><p></p><p>Concluding paragraph: The concluding paragraph will summarize the main points discussed in the body paragraphs, reiterating the importance of staying at home until December (or longer). It may emphasize the need for collective responsibility and solidarity in combating the pandemic, urging readers to prioritize public health and safety over personal conveniences. The conclusion may also provide a call to action, encouraging readers to stay informed, follow guidelines, and contribute to the collective effort of controlling the spread of COVID-19.</p><br />

Lesson LearnedD. Setting Spotlight H. Recommendations1. The film was keen on details and it’s refreshing. This film deserves to be watched to inspire each and every one of us. If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2. Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3. “100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4. 90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5. Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6. Catharsis in Nostalgia by Abigail Eclavea7. It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together.

If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2.Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom.
