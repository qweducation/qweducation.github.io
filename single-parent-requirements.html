One of the parents could be suffering from certain medical issues so they are advised not to have one. They may be trying to have one but still unsuccessful.<strong><br /><br /></strong><strong>Reconstituted Family<br />Also called a reconstructed family or a stepfamily. </strong>When both parents remarried and at least one of the offsprings from either side are brought up, it is called a reconstituted or reconstructed family. <strong><br /><br /></strong><strong>Extended Family<br /></strong>The most basic type of family is Nuclear Family. If this kind of <strong>family extends to the uncles and aunties, grandparents and cousins, it becomes an extended family.</strong> Extended families are living in one household or just nearby.<strong><br /><br /></strong><strong>Nuclear Family<br />The most basic type of family</strong> that makes up the majority of our households today. It is <strong>composed of two parents and their children</strong> living together in harmony. It does not necessary if the children are biological or not (adopted). Aside from these, gender is not a deciding factor to identify if the family is nuclear or not. Parents could be of the same or different sex. More than 70% of the world's family setup falls under this category.<br /><br /><strong>Grandparent Family<br /></strong>If a child or children are raised by grandparents, they belong to the grandparent family type. Regardless of the reason why their are not accompanied by their parents, this type of family occurs mostly in nuclear families where <strong>grandparents took over the responsibility of raising their children.<br /></strong>Unconventional Family<br />The most unexpected type of family in certain norms. In some areas of the world, this type of family is normal. Polygamy is the best example of this. <strong>They are composed of children, a father, and multiple mothers. <br /><br /></strong><strong>Single-Parent Family<br />If one of the parents is widowed, divorced but not remarried, or unmarried, it is called a single-parent family. </strong>Whether the household is headed by parents uncles or grandparents individually raising a child, it falls under this category.<strong><br /></strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>They are still many different things we can learn from different types of families.

What are the similarities between asexual &amp; sexual reproduction?A. Both types of reproduction produce offspring involving all living organisms.B. Both types of reproduction reproduce offspring that appears identical to theparent organisms.c. Both requires two parent cells and results to variation among offspring.D. Both are a quick process and require less energy for genetic variation.32. How are they different when it comes to parents and offspring?A. Sexual reproduction results in variation in the genetic make-up of their offspringbut asexual reproduction produces offspring identical to the parent.B. Sexual reproduction needs two parent organisms that produce a single offspring,while asexual reproduction only needs two parents that produces an offspringidentical in appearance.C. Sexual reproduction needs a single parent and produces multiple offspring, whileasexual reproduction only needs a single parent to produce multiple offspring.D. Sexual reproduction needs a single parent that produces a single offspring, whileasexual reproduction needs to parents that produce an offspring identical inappearance.33. How is sexual reproduction disadvantaged compared to asexual reproduction?A. Sexual reproduction requires more energy because it requires both sexes toparticipateB. There is variation among the offspring in sexual reproduction that help them livelonger to survive.C. There is very little chance of genetic variation in sexual reproduction.D.
