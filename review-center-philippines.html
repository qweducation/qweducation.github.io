                                            Video Games Adversely Affect Children’s BrainsBy: Rafael CastilloA lot of children in the Philippines and worldwide are crazy about video game play (VGP).Some parents even  encourage it with the belief that it can increase their children’s dexterityand  could  even  improve  their   IQ.   We   now   have   robust   scientific   data   indicating   thisimpression to be erroneous.Although some scientific studies suggest that VGP may improve certain types of visual agilityskills, negative effects of VGP outweigh them, with unfavorable effects on verbal memory,attention, sleep, learning and comprehension.Most children regularly engaging in VGP have demonstrated by sophisticated imaging studiesthat the release of the hormone dopamine is increased, which is associated with most types ofaddiction.A high level of dopamine makes one experience pleasure. Repeated exposure to an addictivesubstance or behavior such as playing video games conditions the brain cells in key areas likethe prefrontal cortex—the area of the brain involved in planning and executing tasks—to craveand go after the substance or behavior causing the release of dopamine. The end result is being“addicted” to the source of pleasure, and in our children’s case—addiction to video games.Some scientists describe the effect of video games as “hijacking the pleasure center,” which isthe same reward circuit in the brain involved with motivation and memory. Since an addictivebehavior like VGP stimulates the same circuit, this part becomes “hijacked and overloaded,”unfavorably affecting the child’s memory, learning and motivation to acquire other knowledgeand skills. Hence, for many children, they may prefer playing their video games than doingtheir school assignments or reviewing for their exams.

                                            Video Games Adversely Affect Children’s Brains By: Rafael Castillo
A lot of children in the Philippines and worldwide are crazy about video game play (VGP). Some parents even encourage it with the belief that it can increase their children’s dexterity and could even improve their IQ. We now have robust scientific data indicating this impression to be erroneous
Although some scientific studies suggest that VGP may improve certain types of visual agility skills, negative effects of VGP outweigh them, with unfavorable effects on verbal memory, attention, sleep, learning and comprehension.
Most children regularly engaging in VGP have demonstrated by sophisticated imaging studies that the release of the hormone dopamine is increased, which is associated with most types of addiction.
A high level of dopamine makes one experience pleasure. Repeated exposure to an addictive substance or behavior such as playing video games conditions the brain cells in key areas like the prefrontal cortex—the area of the brain involved in planning and executing tasks—to crave and go after the substance or behavior causing the release of dopamine. The end result is being “addicted” to the source of pleasure, and in our children’s case—addiction to video games.
Some scientists describe the effect of video games as “hijacking the pleasure center,” which is the same reward circuit in the brain involved with motivation and memory. Since an addictive behavior like VGP stimulates the same circuit, this part becomes “hijacked and overloaded,” unfavorably affecting the child’s memory, learning and motivation to acquire other knowledge and skills. Hence, for many children, they may prefer playing their video games than doing their school assignments or reviewing for their exams.

Since an addictivebehavior like VGP stimulates the same circuit, this part becomes “hijacked and overloaded,”unfavorably affecting the child’s memory, learning and motivation to acquire other knowledgeand skills. Hence, for many children, they may prefer playing their video games than doingtheir school assignments or reviewing for their exams.

                        A Reaction to Video Games Adversely Affect Children’s Brains by Rafael Castillo<p></p><p>A. The <strong>argument </strong>presented by the manifesto about children going crazy about the video game they are playing was <strong>logically acceptable.</strong> It was <strong>based on a phenomenon</strong> that is experienced by many people and has backups to the claims. </p><p></p><p>B. The <strong>evidence</strong> presented by the manifesto was according to <strong>scientific studies</strong>. It is also <strong>aligned </strong>with what is being observed in the behaviors of children who are playing video games. It does <strong>not </strong>exaggerate at all. </p><p></p><p>C. The argument presented by the manifesto seems to be a <strong>warning or a wake-up cal</strong>l for game developers in our society. It has given evidence of the effect of games that are too violent. This could lead to <strong>regulation </strong>around the <strong>development of video games</strong> to ensure that they would not lead to any addiction and violent behaviors in our children.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about Video Games here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1497363</p><p>#SPJ1</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            9. Video Games Adversely Affect Children’s Brains By: Rafael Castillo
A lot of children in the Philippines and worldwide are crazy about video game play (VGP). Some parents even encourage it with the belief that it can increase their children’s dexterity and could even improve their IQ. We now have robust scientific data indicating this impression to be erroneous
Although some scientific studies suggest that VGP may improve certain types of visual agility skills, negative effects of VGP outweigh them, with unfavorable effects on verbal memory, attention, sleep, learning and comprehension.
Most children regularly engaging in VGP have demonstrated by sophisticated imaging studies that the release of the hormone dopamine is increased, which is associated with most types of addiction.
A high level of dopamine makes one experience pleasure. Repeated exposure to an addictive substance or behavior such as playing video games conditions the brain cells in key areas like the prefrontal cortex—the area of the brain involved in planning and executing tasks—to crave and go after the substance or behavior causing the release of dopamine. The end result is being “addicted” to the source of pleasure, and in our children’s case—addiction to video games.
Some scientists describe the effect of video games as “hijacking the pleasure center,” which is the same reward circuit in the brain involved with motivation and memory. Since an addictive behavior like VGP stimulates the same circuit, this part becomes “hijacked and overloaded,” unfavorably affecting the child’s memory, learning and motivation to acquire other knowledge and skills. Hence, for many children, they may prefer playing their video games than doing their school assignments or reviewing for their exams.
