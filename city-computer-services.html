                                            Exercise A Directions: Identify the developmental pattern of the given paragraphs. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 1. In recent decades, cities have grown so large that now about 50% of the Earth's population lives in urban areas. There are several reasons for this. First, the increasing industrialization of the nineteenth century resulted in the creation of many factory jobs, which tended to be located in cities. These jobs, with their promise for a better material life, attracted many people from rural areas. Second, there were many schools established to educate the children of the new factory laborers. The promise of a better education persuaded many families to leave farming communities and move to the cities. Finally, as the cities grew, people established places of leisure, entertainment, and culture, such as stadiums, theaters, and museums. For many people, these facilities made city life appear more interesting than life on farm, and therefore, drew them away from rural areas. 2. The internet has evolved from simple dial-up technology to high speed data networks. It has undergone continuous evolution whish was caused by the need of the people to transmit high traffic and high-bandwidth applications over the network. The continuous advancement of software technology on the internet are the Local Area Network (LAN). This connects computers in one location. There is also the Wide Area Network (WAN) which interconnect different LANs. The Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) Wimax allows wireless, internet accessing using internet Protocol (IP). The General Packet Radio Service Networks (GPRS) allows mobile users to access the internet using cellular phones. Then, there is the Voice Over Internet Protoco; (VOIP) which allows telephone calls on the internet using Internet Protocol (IP). The Multimedia Streaming allows Audio/Video streaming over the internet. Then there is GigaPops (Gigabits-per-second Point of Presence) which allows very high speed transmission. Finally, there is the cluster of the Grid Computing which allows intensive computations to be distributed to thousands of computers and let them process computation simultaneously. 3.

                            10. Exercise A Directions: Identify the developmental pattern of the given paragraphs. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 1. In recent decades, cities have grown so large that now about 50% of the Earth's population lives in urban areas. There are several reasons for this. First, the increasing industrialization of the nineteenth century resulted in the creation of many factory jobs, which tended to be located in cities. These jobs, with their promise for a better material life, attracted many people from rural areas. Second, there were many schools established to educate the children of the new factory laborers. The promise of a better education persuaded many families to leave farming communities and move to the cities. Finally, as the cities grew, people established places of leisure, entertainment, and culture, such as stadiums, theaters, and museums. For many people, these facilities made city life appear more interesting than life on farm, and therefore, drew them away from rural areas. 2. The internet has evolved from simple dial-up technology to high speed data networks. It has undergone continuous evolution whish was caused by the need of the people to transmit high traffic and high-bandwidth applications over the network. The continuous advancement of software technology on the internet are the Local Area Network (LAN). This connects computers in one location. There is also the Wide Area Network (WAN) which interconnect different LANs. The Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) Wimax allows wireless, internet accessing using internet Protocol (IP). The General Packet Radio Service Networks (GPRS) allows mobile users to access the internet using cellular phones. Then, there is the Voice Over Internet Protoco; (VOIP) which allows telephone calls on the internet using Internet Protocol (IP). The Multimedia Streaming allows Audio/Video streaming over the internet. Then there is GigaPops (Gigabits-per-second Point of Presence) which allows very high speed transmission. Finally, there is the cluster of the Grid Computing which allows intensive computations to be distributed to thousands of computers and let them process computation simultaneously. 3.
