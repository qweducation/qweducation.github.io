Emmanuel well is a boy of common in what he had and did first he never asked his parents to provide him that things and comfort like what his classmates enjoyed next he refrained himself from comparing his family status with his classmates he believed that blessings come in varied ways most importantly emmanuel found this study is to be venue of challege where he could concentrate his time and effort in order to excel.4. children today are gaining weight massively for several reasons people's change in lifestyle has caused lack of exercise and unhealthy eating habits among the younger ones they are now less active spending a lot of time sitting at computers or a gaming gadget, hence, overweight children are more likely to be overweight as adults this puts them at risk of developing diabetes heart disease and other illness5. the earth's surface is constantly changing through slow process that we don't usually see one is erosion this has worn away rocks and mountains over millions of years caused by air, water, and wind change is caused by earthquakes that originate deep inside the planet  more sudden violent erosionan earthquake results when strains between earth plates produce shock waves editor process results when molten rock formation material called lava, escape on to the surface through gaps in the curtswhat we experience and volcanic eruption.6. captain father was not usual self his face was sad and his steps were slow and tired of all afternoon he had brought nothing for his dear little ones no candies no cookies nothing at all when the children run to meet him father only looked sadly at them and shook his head.7. don't can categorized into many groups dogs might be wild or domesticated wild dogs are those which live in dependently and their natural habitat like the forest domesticated dogs on the other hand are those which have been living and humans for generation dogs can be also classified by breed likepoodles,bulldogs,pomeranian,german shepherd, chihuahua, etc likewise dogs may also be considered as a pet odd or even a hunter depending on their breed(8-10 is in the photo)​</a>

NASA’s new rover Perseverance launches for Mars to seek signs of past life Published by Joey Roulette on July 30, 2020 NASA's next-generation Mars rover Perseverance blasted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral on Thursday atop an Atlas 5 rocket on a $2.4-billion mission to search for traces of potential past life on Earth's planetary neighbor. The next-generation robotic rover—a car-sized six-wheeled scientific vehicle—also is scheduled to deploy a mini helicopter on Mars and test out equipment for future human missions to the fourth planet from the sun. It is expected to reach Mars next February. It soared into the sky under clear, sunny and warm conditions carried by an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance. The launch took place after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California where its mission engineers were located was rattled by an earthquake. This marked NASA's ninth journey to the Martian surface. Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars—once a much more hospitable place than it is today—ever harbored life. Water is considered a key ingredient for life, and Mars billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost. One of the most complex maneuvers in Perseverance's journey will be what mission engineers call the "seven minutes of terror," when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet's surface. This was scheduled as the third launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China. The state from which the rover was launched, Florida, is currently one of the hot spots in the United States for the coronavirus pandemic. Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time. Since NASA's first Mars rover Sojourner landed in 1997, the agency has sent two others—Spirit and Opportunity—that have explored the geology of expansive Martian plains and detected signs of past water formations, among other discoveries. NASA also has successfully sent three landers: Pathfinder, Phoenix, InSight. The United States has plans to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s under a program that envisions using a return to the moon as a testing platform for human missions before making the more ambitious crewed journey to Mars. Perseverance will conduct an experiment to convert elements of the carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere into propellant for future rockets launching off the planet's surface, or to produce breathable oxygen for future astronauts. The rover also is intended to help bring Martian rock samples back to Earth, collecting materials in cigar-sized capsules and leaving them in various spots on the surface for retrieval by a future "fetch" rover. That planned rover is expected to launch the samples back into space to link up with other spacecraft for an eventual Earth homecoming around 2031. —

Earthquake is vibrations or tremors produced within the earth's outer layer or crust2. The study of earthquakes is termed seismology.3. A fault is a break in the Earth's crust, and along the break, significant movement hastaken place.4. The place where the earthquake starts is called the focus, along the fault plane.5. The spot on the surface of the Earth that is directly above the focus is called theepicentre.6. The strength/energy of an earthquake is called the intensity.7. The strength of the movement of an earthquake of how strong or weak is the shaking iscalled the magnitude.8.Inactive fault on the other hand is a kind of fault that cannot give an earthquake todaybut they did so in the past.9.

NASA’s new rover Perseverance launches for Mars to seek signs of past life Published by Joey Roulette on July 30, 2020 NASA's next-generation Mars rover Perseverance blasted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral on Thursday atop an Atlas 5 rocket on a $2.4-billion mission to search for traces of potential past life on Earth's planetary neighbor. The next-generation robotic rover—a car-sized six-wheeled scientific vehicle—also is scheduled to deploy a mini helicopter on Mars and test out equipment for future human missions to the fourth planet from the sun. It is expected to reach Mars next February. It soared into the sky under clear, sunny and warm conditions carried by an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance. The launch took place after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California where its mission engineers were located was rattled by an earthquake. This marked NASA's ninth journey to the Martian surface. Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars—once a much more hospitable place than it is today—ever harbored life. Water is considered a key ingredient for life, and Mars billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost. One of the most complex maneuvers in Perseverance's journey will be what mission engineers call the "seven minutes of terror," when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet's surface. This was scheduled as the third launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China. The state from which the rover was launched, Florida, is currently one of the hot spots in the United States for the coronavirus pandemic. Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time. Since NASA's first Mars rover Sojourner landed in 1997, the agency has sent two others—Spirit and Opportunity—that have explored the geology of expansive Martian plains and detected signs of past water formations, among other discoveries. NASA also has successfully sent three landers: Pathfinder, Phoenix, InSight. The United States has plans to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s under a program that envisions using a return to the moon as a testing platform for human missions before making the more ambitious crewed journey to Mars. Perseverance will conduct an experiment to convert elements of the carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere into propellant for future rockets launching off the planet's surface, or to produce breathable oxygen for future astronauts. The rover also is intended to help bring Martian rock samples back to Earth, collecting materials in cigar-sized capsules and leaving them in various spots on the surface for retrieval by a future "fetch" rover. That planned rover is expected to launch the samples back into space to link up with other spacecraft for an eventual Earth homecoming around 2031. —
