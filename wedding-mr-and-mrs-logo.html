Blank, of Barton Park, was found strangled this morning in the cottage owned by John Doe. 25, who was apprehended on the scene of the crime by officers Bailey and Hodge. Doe was found holding the body in his arms, and appeared to be in stupor, his only reply to repeated questioning being. "I killed her because I loved her." According to the members of the Blank family. Doe had paid attention to Miss Blank for the last several months, though it was strenuously denied that his regards for Miss Blank was returned. Miss Blank's engagement with Mr. Roger Weston was announced last month. Mr. Weston could not be reached for a statement. Mrs. Blank was prostrated by the news of her daughter's death. The slain girl vanished last evening at approximately eleven o'clock from a dinner party given at her parent's home in honour of the approaching wedding. The family became alarmed when it was discovered that she was not in her room, and instituted a search for her about midnight. The police. who were promptly notified, in the course of their search knocked at Mr. Doe's cottage, a building some quarter of a mile from the Blank estate, at five in the morning. Receiving no answer, they forced the door and discovered Doe sitting with the dead girl in his lap. She had apparently been strangled. Dr. A. P. Reynolds. Autopsy Surgeon for the county. state that, from the condition of the body, death must have occurred at about midnight. 1.how was the incident reported in each text​</a>
