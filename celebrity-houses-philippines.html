                                            a The Philippines is known as the festive capital of the world. Every place in the country has a festival of its own. As such, every 30th of April, Lopezenos celebrates the "Pamaypayan Festival" as its annual festival celebrating its good harvest and a year full of blessings. It originated from the term "pamaypay" the native Tagalog word for fan, which is used to cool oneself in hot weather. This pamaypay comes in different colors and sizes. Pamaypayan is a place or house for the weavers of Pamaypay. As their one-town-one product (OTOP), it promotes pamaypay and its sub-products, such as hats, bags, slippers, and costumes made of anahaw, buli, and indigenous materials. The festival also aims to promote the weavers of pamaypay who could transform the commodity they produced into a highly valuable product that is not only known in the local but also the international market. need napo ​</a>

</p><p>________________7. You will find the vase beside the chair. - <strong>Objective</strong>
</p><p>________________8. Ben, take this. - <strong>Subjective</strong>
</p><p>________________9. Maria went to town.- <strong>Subjective</strong>
</p><p>________________10. Vice Ganda’s house was as huge as Philippine Arena. - <strong>Possessive</strong>
</p><p>________________11. Cinderella’s shoe was nice.- <strong>Possessive</strong>
</p><p>________________12. Ryan celebrated valentine’s day.- <strong>Subjective</strong>

</p><p>________________15. Helping the victims of Typhoon Odeth is a nice gesture. ​- <strong>Subjective</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The grammatical technique in which writers show how nouns or pronouns relate to other words in a sentence is through <strong>noun cases</strong>. The function of a noun within a sentence is referred to as its case. <strong>Subjective, objective,</strong> and <strong>possessive</strong> are the three noun cases. Each case refers to the function and placement of a noun in the sentence in relation to the other words.</p><p><strong></strong></p>Subjective<p>When nouns and pronouns assume the form of the sentence's subject or are employed as predicate nouns, they appear in the subjective (also known as the nominative) case. Predicate nouns are preceded by different forms of the verb "be," which re-identify the subject. </p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>"The woman is a waitress."
</p><p>
Here, the word "is" -- a "be" verb -- precedes the word "waitress," which renames "[t]he woman." That means the noun case is subjective.</p><p></p>Objective<p>When a noun or pronoun occurs as a direct or indirect object, the objective case is employed. In sentences, direct objects are more common. They come after transitive or action verbs, whereas indirect objects indicate the verb's action's object as well as the direct object's recipient. It's also appropriate when the noun is the subject of a preposition.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>"The girl jumped over the couch."
</p><p>
Here, the couch is the object of the preposition, making the noun case objective.</p><p></p>Possessive<p>The possessive case is used to express ownership of nouns and pronouns. The possessive apostrophe is placed to match the ownership indicated by the possessive noun case. While there are exceptions for spelling, the apostrophe comes before the "s" in a singular possessive, while the apostrophe comes after the "s" in plural possessives.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>"Carrie ate Tommy's pancakes."
</p><p>
Tommy is the owner of the pancakes, and so the case is possessive.</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><br />
