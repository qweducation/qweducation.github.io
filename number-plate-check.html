Write the letter of the correct answer on the space provided before the number. 1. Metals are formed into structures by assembling or connecting each member parts through the process of welding. 2. Using the neutral pre-heat flame, heat the spot where you intend to start until the flame turns cherry red. 3. The pre-heat flame should be held just above the metal surface so as to protect pre-heat holes against metal flow back from the pure cutting oxygen. 4. Materials (plates) over 305mm thick (12 inches) should cut using 19.9-31.8mm coupling distance. 5. The distance between the end of the pre-heat cones and the surface of the material being cut is known as the coupling distance. 6. Proper cleaning of metal surfaces and edges must be in mind before any fit-up and tacking took placed. 7. A typical oxyacetylene cutting and welding outfit requires compressed oxygen and acetylene gases that are stored in the cylinders separately. 8. Edge A needs to be grind smoothly and squarely so that no gaps appear on the fit-up and the surface of the other plate to form Tee-joint. 9. Before tacking, airtight fit-up must be checked so as to avoid air pockets in the fitted edge or surface. 10. Safety precautions are not observed at all times. 11. Removal of metal scales, old points, rust in metal is easy with the use of grinder. 12. Beveled joint is considered "critical" in the category of weld. 13. Root face of beveled joint will not exceed a maximum of 6 mm. 14. Once the cut starts, the torch must be moved steadily in the direction of the cut. 15. When bevel cutting is required, the torch head must be inclined in the position to the preheated metal along the top edge of the parts.​</a>

After looking around, it seems like no one else, including the man in front of you, saw the bill fall. What will you do? a. Consider it a good karma for the P500 you lost last month on the subway, pick it up when you get to the counter and use it to pay for your coffee. b. Tap the man on the shoulder and tell him that he accidentally dropped his money. c. Pick up the P500 bill and put it in the tip jar when you reach the counter.

On your way to work you noticed the woman in the car driving in front of you putting on her makeup as she drives. Several minutes later she knocks the side mirror off of a parked car and keeps going. What will you do? a. Get the license plate number of the car in front of you and pull over to leave a note for the owner of the damaged parked car. b. Take a video of the car in front of you, narrating what just happened and post it to YouTube with the hope that the owner of the damaged car will see it. c. Pretend you didn’t see anything and continue on your route to work. d. Get the license plate number of the car in front of you and call the non- emergency police number to report the accident.​</a>

                            28. Direction: Write TRUE if the statement is correct or FALSE if it is wrong. Write the letter of the correct answer on the space provided before the number. 1. Metals are formed into structures by assembling or connecting each member parts through the process of welding. 2. Using the neutral pre-heat flame, heat the spot where you intend to start until the flame turns cherry red. 3. The pre-heat flame should be held just above the metal surface so as to protect pre-heat holes against metal flow back from the pure cutting oxygen. 4. Materials (plates) over 305mm thick (12 inches) should cut using 19.9-31.8mm coupling distance. 5. The distance between the end of the pre-heat cones and the surface of the material being cut is known as the coupling distance. 6. Proper cleaning of metal surfaces and edges must be in mind before any fit-up and tacking took placed. 7. A typical oxyacetylene cutting and welding outfit requires compressed oxygen and acetylene gases that are stored in the cylinders separately. 8. Edge A needs to be grind smoothly and squarely so that no gaps appear on the fit-up and the surface of the other plate to form Tee-joint. 9. Before tacking, airtight fit-up must be checked so as to avoid air pockets in the fitted edge or surface. 10. Safety precautions are not observed at all times. 11. Removal of metal scales, old points, rust in metal is easy with the use of grinder. 12. Beveled joint is considered "critical" in the category of weld. 13. Root face of beveled joint will not exceed a maximum of 6 mm. 14. Once the cut starts, the torch must be moved steadily in the direction of the cut. 15. When bevel cutting is required, the torch head must be inclined in the position to the preheated metal along the top edge of the parts.​</h2><br />
