Write your answers in your paper (samepaper you used in Exercise 1).1. Rinse suds and residue with clean hot water. Rinse by dipping in a rinsing sink orpan, passing under a stream or spray of hot water; or, by placing them in a dryingrack and pouring or spraying water over them.2. Fill sink or dishpan with clean, hot water. Add dish soap to the water (read the labelfor dosage; some concentrated dish detergents require a smaller amount). Stack afew dishes in the sink at a time - this allows a few minutes of soaking time whileyou work on washing.3. Scrape dishes to remove leftover food - use a rubber spatula or paper towel. Forstuck-on foods, soak dishes/cookware before washing add detergent or baking sodato the sink/dishpan (or soiled pot) and fill with hot water; soak for 15 to 30 minutes,then drain.4. Air drying is easier than towel drying. However, wiping with a clean towel is helpfulwhen glassware or flatware is spotted or filmed. Make sure the towel is clean andchange the towel when it becomes damp.5. Wash "in order," starting with lightly soiled items. This usually includes glasses,cups, and flatware. Washing these items first followed by plates/bowls and servingdishes. In general, dishes wash easily if you keep them under the water whilescrubbing them; as you work, pull each dish out of the water to check for missedspots.

Rinse by dipping in a rinsing sink orpan, passing under a stream or spray of hot water; or, by placing them in a dryingrack and pouring or spraying water over them.2. Fill sink or dishpan with clean, hot water. Add dish soap to the water (read the labelfor dosage; some concentrated dish detergents require a smaller amount). Stack afew dishes in the sink at a time - this allows a few minutes of soaking time whileyou work on washing.3. Scrape dishes to remove leftover food - use a rubber spatula or paper towel. Forstuck-on foods, soak dishes/cookware before washing add detergent or baking sodato the sink/dishpan (or soiled pot) and fill with hot water; soak for 15 to 30 minutes,then drain.4. Air drying is easier than towel drying. However, wiping with a clean towel is helpfulwhen glassware or flatware is spotted or filmed. Make sure the towel is clean andchange the towel when it becomes damp.5. Wash "in order," starting with lightly soiled items. This usually includes glasses,cups, and flatware. Washing these items first followed by plates/bowls and servingdishes. In general, dishes wash easily if you keep them under the water whilescrubbing them; as you work, pull each dish out of the water to check for missedspots.
