Consequently, even if two volcanoes have similar eruption histories, one might be dormant and the other extinet. For example, some types of volcanoes experience only one eruption, and these might be classified as extinct even if they erupted in recent history. Other types erupt at intervals of hundreds of thousands of years and cannot be considered extinct even if the last eruption occurred well over ten thousand years ago. 5.

As the surface of the ocean heats up, the water goes up into the air. This warm air becomes moist. It starts to form a column. The air around rushes toward the column and creates a spiral around it. The system is called a cyclone.​</a>

Consequently, even if two volcanoes have similar eruption histories, one might be dormant and the other extinet. For example, some types of volcanoes experience only one eruption, and these might be classified as extinct even if they erupted in recent history. Other types erupt at intervals of hundreds of thousands of years and cannot be considered extinct even if the last eruption occurred well over ten thousand years ago. 5.
