                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>When an organisation has made a decision to enter an overseas market, there are a variety of options open to it. These options vary with cost, risk and the degree of control which can be exercised over them. The simplest form of entry strategy is exporting using either a direct or indirect method such as an agent, in the case of the former, or countertrade, in the case of the latter. More complex forms include truly global operations which may involve joint ventures, or export processing zones. Having decided on the form of export strategy, decisions have to be made on the specific channels. Many agricultural products of a raw or commodity nature use agents, distributors or involve Government, whereas processed materials, whilst not excluding these, rely more heavily on more sophisticated forms of access. These will be expanded on later.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>yes po, that's right again, if i wrong please told me. thank you!</p><p></p><br />

2. Despite the talent available in the local entrepreneurial pool, the Philippine startup ecosystem is not enticing enough for those looking to start a business. How can the government boost the startup ecosystem and better support, local entrepreneurs?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>1.</strong> The availability of programs and initiatives to support small-time entrepreneurs with limited capital may vary depending on the country and region. However, in many countries, including the Philippines, there are several government initiatives aimed at helping small entrepreneurs to start up their businesses. These initiatives may include financial assistance such as grants, loans, and subsidies, as well as training and mentoring programs, and access to networks and resources.</p><p>While there are initiatives available, it is still a challenge for small entrepreneurs to access them. The requirements and qualifications for eligibility may be too strict, or the application process may be too complicated, which can discourage some entrepreneurs from pursuing these opportunities. Furthermore, the funding allocated to these programs may not be enough to meet the demand, leading to a limited number of beneficiaries.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. </strong>To boost the startup ecosystem and better support local entrepreneurs, the government can implement the following strategies:</p><p><strong>a)</strong> Simplify the process of applying for government programs and initiatives to make it easier for small entrepreneurs to access them. The government can provide online resources and other tools to help entrepreneurs understand the eligibility criteria, application procedures, and other requirements.</p><p></p><p><strong>b)</strong> Increase funding for small business support programs and initiatives. This can include increasing the allocation of funds to existing programs or creating new programs to meet the growing demand for support among small entrepreneurs.</p><p></p><p><strong>c)</strong> Establish partnerships with private sector organizations and investors to provide access to capital and other resources to small entrepreneurs. These partnerships can help entrepreneurs to access new markets, technology, and other resources that can help them grow and succeed.</p><p></p><p><strong>d)</strong> Foster a culture of entrepreneurship by providing education and training programs to young people and encouraging them to pursue entrepreneurial ventures. The government can also support startup incubators and accelerators, which can provide a supportive environment for entrepreneurs to test and launch new business ideas.</p><p></p><p><strong>e)</strong> Provide tax incentives and other regulatory support for small businesses. This can include reducing tax burdens for small businesses and streamlining the process of registering and licensing new businesses.</p><p></p><p>By implementing these strategies, the government can help create a more conducive environment for small entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses. This, in turn, can lead to job creation, economic growth, and a more vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p><br />
