Smile
Prose Poetry by Conchitina Cruz
The man who thinks he is God likes to say “I forgive you.” Because they are obliged to be kind, the nurses ignore him as he raises his right hand to bless them. While they change the sheets, he forgives the world beyond his window, the trees, the parked cars, the janitor sweeping the cigarette stubs off the sidewalk. I forgive you. I forgive you. The nurses lead him to bed, then leave. They cannot stand his eyes, full of pity and condescension.
To the doctor, he says nothing. He thinks she is the Virgin Mary, and even God is in awe of The One Without Sin. She approaches his body with the method of a mechanic. She listens to his heart, his pulse, his lungs, inspects his ears, checks his reflexes. In a few minutes, she will be out of this hospital, in her parked car, off to a date with the man she believes she will marry.
When the patient catches her eye, the doctor is somewhere else, in bed, holding the blanket close to her body as her future husband holds a camera above her. “Smile,” he says, and she does. The man who thinks he is God returns the smile of the woman before him, the Virgin Mother, and the room is flooded with the radiance of the moment, a man and a woman in the middle of a sweet misunderstanding.

1. An electronic device has a resista sice of 20 ohm's and current of 15 amperes. What is the
voltag across the device?
2. How many amperes of current wil flow through a circuit that has 3 ohms of resistans e if
power d by a 12-volt battery?
3. The sid: lights of a car have 10 oams of resistance. How much current will a 12 volt battery

create through the lights?
4. What is the current in the 30 ohm heating coil of a coffee n aker that operates on a 120 volt
circuit
5. A 3V potential difference is applied across 6 ohms. What is the current that flows into the
resisto?
6. What is the resistance of a curling, iron that draws 12 A of current on a 120 V circuit
7. What is the voltage across a 100 chm circuit element that draws a current of 1 A?
8. What voltage will produce 3 A hrough a circuit that has 5 ohms of resistance?
9. Household circuits in the Philippines commonly run on 20 volts of electricity. Frequently, circuit
breakers are installed that open a circuit if it is drawing n pre than 30 amps of current. What is the
minin um amount of resistance that must be present in the circuit to prevent the circuit breaker from
activating?
10. The current in an incandescent amp is 0.5 Amperes when connected to a 120 Voltige circuit, and 0.2
Amperes when connected to a 10 Voltage source. Does the resistance of the lamp change in these cases?
Explain your answer using you notes (hint: connect voltage to temperature of the circuit and temperature
to resistance of the circuit). Support your answer mathematically.</a>

One of the main reason of traffic accidents are the carelessdrivers.Some drivers ignore traffic rules and warning signs ang signals. The weather condition may alsoewsult in traffic accidents, Drivers tend to lose control during a heavy rain when the roads areslippery. Accidents also happen because of too many cars. To sum up traffic accidents are causeby careless driversm weather condition and too many cars. Drivers should consider this to avoidaccidents.20.

The top horizon, or layer is called top soil. Itis dark brown, very loose, has very few rocks, and contains a lot of hummus, which is decomposedorganic matter. Subsoil, just below the top soil, is lighter in color, packed more tightly, and containsless hummus and more rocks. Unlike the top horizon, the very bottom horizon, which rests on bedrock.contains no hummus at all, is very compact, and is full of rocks.23.

Dr. Miller doesn't want the tigers to vanish. These majestic beasts are disappearing at analarming rate. Dr. Miller thinks that we should write to our congress people. If we let them know thatwe demand the preservation of this species, maybe we can make a difference. Dr. Miller also thinksthat we should donate to Save the Tigers. Our donations will help to support and empower thosewho are fighting the hardest to preserve the tigers. We owe it to our grandchildren to do something.25.

Smile
Prose Poetry by Conchitina Cruz
The man who thinks he is God likes to say “I forgive you.” Because they are obliged to be kind, the nurses ignore him as he raises his right hand to bless them. While they change the sheets, he forgives the world beyond his window, the trees, the parked cars, the janitor sweeping the cigarette stubs off the sidewalk. I forgive you. I forgive you. The nurses lead him to bed, then leave. They cannot stand his eyes, full of pity and condescension.
To the doctor, he says nothing. He thinks she is the Virgin Mary, and even God is in awe of The One Without Sin. She approaches his body with the method of a mechanic. She listens to his heart, his pulse, his lungs, inspects his ears, checks his reflexes. In a few minutes, she will be out of this hospital, in her parked car, off to a date with the man she believes she will marry.
When the patient catches her eye, the doctor is somewhere else, in bed, holding the blanket close to her body as her future husband holds a camera above her. “Smile,” he says, and she does. The man who thinks he is God returns the smile of the woman before him, the Virgin Mother, and the room is flooded with the radiance of the moment, a man and a woman in the middle of a sweet misunderstanding.

8. What voltage will produce 3 A hrough a circuit that has 5 ohms of resistance?
9. Household circuits in the Philippines commonly run on 20 volts of electricity. Frequently, circuit
breakers are installed that open a circuit if it is drawing n pre than 30 amps of current. What is the
minin um amount of resistance that must be present in the circuit to prevent the circuit breaker from
activating?
