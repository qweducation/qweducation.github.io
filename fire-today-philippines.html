Rizal's 124th death anniversary, President Rodrigo Duterte hailed the frontliners who emerged as heroes amid challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. "Today, we see many Rizals fighting for our people, this time against an unseen adversary-a pandemic. We have our brave frontliners who continue to serve the nation in their unique capacities notwithstanding the risks to life and limb. In them, we see a new expression of heroism that is truly inspiring," Duterte said in his Rizal Day message. "May we continue to celebrate Jose Rizal and our modern-day heroes, to learn from their example, and to express the love and respect of a grateful nation," he added. Duterte also hailed Rizal's bravery in fighting oppression which ignited nationalism among Filipinos. "Rizal had great aspirations for his motherland and he used the power of the pen to convey sentiments against oppression and yearnings for emancipation," he said. "To the extent that it ignited a stronger sense of nationalism and a revolution, he was successful. He was our hero," Duterte added. Rizal was 35 years old when he was executed by firing squad in Bagumbayan, Manila for the crime of rebellion under the Spanish colonial rule. 1. Which of the two is a feature article? 2.

Answer the questions JOSE RIZAL Jose Rizal was born on June 19, 1861 in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines as Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda. He was a writer, known for El Filibusterismo (1962), Sisa (1951) and Noli Me Tangere (1930). He died on December 30, 1896 in Bagumbayan (now Luneta), Manila, Philippines. He was a skilled linguist; in his many travels in Europe and Asia, he was able to pick up the language of whatever country he visited and stayed for a protracted amount of time. He was also a talented artist, and there are sketches of his work which are still intact today. He was married to an Irish woman, Josephine Bracken, toward the end of his life. They had a son, but he died shortly after birth. Before he was executed on 30 December 1894, he requested to be shot facing the firing squad, and this had denied him, so they shot him in the back. Despite this, after the squad opened fire, Rizal summoned his strength and turned to face the soldiers, and then fell flat on his back with his eyes looking in the sky. 1.

Our country is surrounded by huge bodies of water and is along the Pacific Ring of Fire. While it is the role of key government agencies, such as the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, to give opportunities for its citizens to participate in programs that promote disaster preparedness, people must realize that human activities and decisions that are being made today will be the fate of the future generation.

                                            Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

                                            “5.3-magnitude quake hits Luzon, Philippines”                An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.3 jolted Luzon of the Philippines on Sunday morning, the US Geological Survey said. The epicenter, with a depth of 86.86 km, was initially determined to be at 14.0476 degrees north latitude and 120.525 degrees east longitude. The three widely felt earthquakes shook the Philippines today, but it’s unclear if they triggered each other. The earthquake, which struck at 3.18am. local time on Sunday, was centered in the sea, about 31km (20 miles) northeast of Lubang Island, or 89km (55 miles) west of Calamba and 65km (41 miles) southwest of Balanga. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) said the quake measured 5.5 and struck at a depth of 85km (53 miles), which is relatively deep. There is no threat of a tsunami but aftershocks are likely, according to PHIVOLCS. Shaking from the earthquake was felt across the region, including in Manila and Quezon City, where some said the tremors were strong enough to wake them. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The Philippines is on the so-called ‘Pacific Ring of Fire’, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin which are prone to frequent and large earthquakes. Volcanic eruptions also occur frequently in the region. - The Philippines Daily Inquirer/ Asian News Network, May 16, 2020.upWhat is earthquakes?What is the relationship between earthquakes and fault?​</a>

                            4. ARTICLE B: Duterte hails COVID-19 frontliners on Rizal Day by: Krissy Aguilar MANILA, Philippines - As the country marks national hero Dr. Jose P. Rizal's 124th death anniversary, President Rodrigo Duterte hailed the frontliners who emerged as heroes amid challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. "Today, we see many Rizals fighting for our people, this time against an unseen adversary-a pandemic. We have our brave frontliners who continue to serve the nation in their unique capacities notwithstanding the risks to life and limb. In them, we see a new expression of heroism that is truly inspiring," Duterte said in his Rizal Day message. "May we continue to celebrate Jose Rizal and our modern-day heroes, to learn from their example, and to express the love and respect of a grateful nation," he added. Duterte also hailed Rizal's bravery in fighting oppression which ignited nationalism among Filipinos. "Rizal had great aspirations for his motherland and he used the power of the pen to convey sentiments against oppression and yearnings for emancipation," he said. "To the extent that it ignited a stronger sense of nationalism and a revolution, he was successful. He was our hero," Duterte added. Rizal was 35 years old when he was executed by firing squad in Bagumbayan, Manila for the crime of rebellion under the Spanish colonial rule. 1. Which of the two is a feature article? 2.

                            8. Growing Our Future
There’s some good news as the nation marks Forestry Week starting today and hosts a five-day international gathering to mark the event. Studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization show that the quality of forest management in the Asia-Pacific region has generally improved, resulting in growth in planted and protected forest areas along with an increase in forestry products to meet growing demand.
The Asia-Pacific, which now accounts for 18.1 percent of the global total of forest cover, has seen its forest area increase by five million hectares since 2010 and 20 million since 2000, according to the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Production of sawn timber, wood-based panels and other goods from the forest have also gone up significantly, the report noted. In the Philippines, the forest area has expanded by an average rate 
of 240,000 hectares per year, according to the report. 
The positive developments have been attributed to sustainable forestry policies, which take into account the needs of poor communities that live on forest resources. Instead of preventing them from engaging in their marginal livelihood activities, they are turned into stakeholders in sustainable forestry. International cooperation in forest conservation and better enforcement of laws protecting forest resources have also led to positive results.
Problems persist, however, as destructive forestry activities and weak conservation measures continue to deplete forests. In some countries, forests are being cleared through the quick but destructive slash-and-burn method to make way for farms to produce biofuels. The destruction of forests is also depriving animals such as the orangutan of their natural habitats.
Communities understand the need to make their livelihood sources sustainable. Projects promoting reforestation, reduced impact logging, and training in forest fire management have been supported by these communities. They understand this special week’s theme, which likens sustainable forestry to growing our future.
In the Philippines, people have suffered through enough killer typhoons, landslides and floods to understand the importance of maintaining watersheds. There has been laudable progress in efforts to save the forests. Still, much work remains and gains can be reversed if vigilance is not sustained.

                            18. “5.3-magnitude quake hits Luzon, Philippines”                An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.3 jolted Luzon of the Philippines on Sunday morning, the US Geological Survey said. The epicenter, with a depth of 86.86 km, was initially determined to be at 14.0476 degrees north latitude and 120.525 degrees east longitude. The three widely felt earthquakes shook the Philippines today, but it’s unclear if they triggered each other. The earthquake, which struck at 3.18am. local time on Sunday, was centered in the sea, about 31km (20 miles) northeast of Lubang Island, or 89km (55 miles) west of Calamba and 65km (41 miles) southwest of Balanga. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) said the quake measured 5.5 and struck at a depth of 85km (53 miles), which is relatively deep. There is no threat of a tsunami but aftershocks are likely, according to PHIVOLCS. Shaking from the earthquake was felt across the region, including in Manila and Quezon City, where some said the tremors were strong enough to wake them. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The Philippines is on the so-called ‘Pacific Ring of Fire’, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin which are prone to frequent and large earthquakes. Volcanic eruptions also occur frequently in the region. - The Philippines Daily Inquirer/ Asian News Network, May 16, 2020.upWhat is earthquakes?What is the relationship between earthquakes and fault?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>1. An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. And it's unpredictable happening.</p><p></p><p>2. When an earthquake occurs on one of the faults, the rock on one side of the fault slips with respect to the other. It is where earthquake occurs.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>Just that :)</p><br />
