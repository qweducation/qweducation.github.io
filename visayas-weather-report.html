PAGASA warned of scattered rainshowers and thunderstorms in the following areas: Eastern Visayas, CentralVisayas and Mindanao.The rain will be moderate to heavy at times, which could trigger flash floodsand landslides. PAGASA Weather Specialist Raymond Ordinario said the LPAonly has a slim chance of developing into a tropical depression. The state weatherbureau earlier said La Niña is likely to continue until March. This means abovenormal rainfall would persist. Meanwhile, the northeast monsoon or hangingamihan is still affecting Luzon.There may be isolated light rain due to thenortheast monsoon, but PAGASA said there would be "no significant impact."Answer the questions brief and concise:1.

                            11. PAGASA warns areas affected by the low-pressure area and the
intertropical convergence zone to be on alert for floods and landslides. A newly
formed low-pressure area (LPA) embedded along the intertropical convergence
zone (ITCZ) is bringing rain to several areas in the Visayas and Mindanao. The
Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration
(PAGASA) said on Thursday afternoon, January 7, 2021 that the LPA was located
265 kilometers east southeast of Davao City. PAGASA warned of scattered rain
showers and thunderstorms in the following areas: Eastern Visayas,Central
Visayas and Mindanao.
The rain will be moderate to heavy at times, which could trigger flash floods
and landslides. PAGASA Weather Specialist Raymond Ordinario said the LPA
only has a slim chance of developing into a tropical depression. The state weather
bureau earlier said La Niña is likely to continue until March. This means above
normal rainfall would persist. Meanwhile, the northeast monsoon or hanging
amihan is still affecting Luzon.There may be isolated light rain due to the
northeast monsoon, but PAGASA said there would be "no significant impact."

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The Intertropical Convergence Zone, known by sailors as the doldrums or the calms because of its monotonous windless weather, is the area where the northeast and the southeast trade winds converge. It encircles Earth near the thermal equator though its specific position varies seasonally.</p><p></p><p>2.

(ITCZ) will bring scattered rain showers and thunderstorms over the Visayas, the Bicol Region, and Mimaropa.</p><p></p><p>5. Seasonal shifts in the location of the ITCZ drastically affects rainfall in many equatorial nations, resulting in the wet and dry seasons of the tropics rather than the cold and warm seasons of higher latitudes.
