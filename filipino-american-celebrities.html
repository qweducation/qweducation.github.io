February 14 has been celebrated as Valentine's Day throughout the universe. It is the day singled out for sending flowers, greeting cards, bars of chocolates, heart-shaped gifts and objects to someone special in our lives. Likewise, it is the day for expressing one's undying love to a sweet heart or secret love. But we must not forget that it is not only this day that we must say our love but also make everyday a Valentine's Day. (p. 16, Improving Study, Thinking, Reading, and Writing Skills for College Freshmen by Cabrera, L., et. al) Text Type 2 There are similarities and differences of the Philippine and American good manner. Both types of behavior aim to put them at ease. Both intend to show sincerity and goodwill. However, the Americans are frank, open and straightforward and the Filipinos are timid, verbose, and over polite. The Americans consider loud laughing and hand shaking vigorously but Filipinos consider these actions as a breach of etiquette. On the other hand, the Filipino offers his guests the most delicious food at the best accommodation at home. The Filipinos are well known for their hospitality. They display their simplicity and humility in action and speech. (p. 174, improving Study, Thinking, Reading and writing skills for college freshmen by cabrear,L,et.al)​</h2><br />
