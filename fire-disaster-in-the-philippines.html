                                            The Philippines is said to be in a “hotspot” for natural disasters. Our country is surrounded by huge bodies of water and is along the Pacific Ring of Fire. While it is the role of key government agencies, such as the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, to give opportunities for its citizens to participate in programs that promote disaster preparedness, people must realize that human activities and decisions that are being made today will be the fate of the future generation. As a student, what can you do to respond to disasters when it will happen to our country?</a>

The country’s people and economy are especially vulnerable to the impacts of natural hazards due to their dependency on climate-reliant activities such as agriculture and on coastal and marine resources. Given the limited resources available, it is vital that available funding for disaster preparedness and relief is allocated based on accurate forecasts and evidence.<p></p>This report investigates why further disaster risk policy intervention may be required at the local level in the Philippines and provides guidance to policymakers on the focus for providing improved interventions. The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has focused the need even more on enhancing preparedness as a more effective strategy than solely managing and responding to disasters. The pandemic could fundamentally change the international political system and donor investment priorities, so it is timely to reinforce the importance of pre-disaster investments to build resilience to future shocks.<p></p>For the Philippines, the COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t the only disaster to hit the country in 2020. The year started out with a volcanic eruption and closed with two magnitude 6 earthquakes, one of them striking on Christmas morning. In between came Typhoon Goni, a late-season superstorm that was the strongest in the world last year.<p></p>Located along the typhoon belt in the Pacific, the Philippines is visited by an average of[tex]\sf\red{20 \:typhoons\: every\: year}[/tex], five of which are destructive.<p></p>At least [tex]\sf \red6\red0 \% \: [/tex]of the country’s total land area, nearly [tex]\sf\red{300,000} \: [/tex]square kilometers [tex]\sf\red{(116,000  \: square \:  miles)} \: [/tex], is vulnerable to natural hazards, in large part due to the archipelago’s location along both the path of the tropical storms brewing in the western Pacific and the Ring of Fire.<p></p>Around [tex] \sf \red7\red4 \%[/tex]of its population of more than [tex] \sf\red{100 \:million}[/tex] is subject to various impacts from these disasters, and the country routinely ranks among the top 10 natural disaster-prone countries in the world, according to the World Risk Index.<p></p><p>[tex]\red{⊱─━━━━━━━━⊱༻●༺⊰━━━━━━━━─⊰} \: [/tex]</p><p>[tex] \tiny\red{\boxed{\boxed{\ ✎Carry \:  On \: Learning}}}  \tiny \red { -Mayume}\: [/tex]</p><br />

                            5. The Philippines is said to be in a “hotspot” for natural disasters. Our country is surrounded by huge bodies of water and is along the Pacific Ring of Fire. While it is the role of key government agencies, such as the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, to give opportunities for its citizens to participate in programs that promote disaster preparedness, people must realize that human activities and decisions that are being made today will be the fate of the future generation.
