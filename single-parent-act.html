Its goal is to explore and bring out the various emotions and insights of the participants to uas concepts in the findings of the study.The results of this study have shown that single parents of school children face a lot of variouadversities in life. Financial and emotional adversities in taking care and supporting the needs of their childreare common dilemmas they stand against. Few single parents can successfully raise children alone, despite thesocial expectation that noncustodial parents (usually the father) should only be responsible for supplementafinancial support, while the custodial parent (usually the mother) takes on both parenting and economic roles(Goldscheider and Waite 1991). The behavior of children may also be affected by the separation of parents. Infact, according to a study, many fathers stop seeing their children regularly after the firs year of divorce. Thiscan cause children to act out from the hurt and lack of a positive male role model. Behavioral problems can alsooccur when single moms are working too hard, making it more difficult to manage discipline effectively (Welton,2015).Recommendations 5: pa helps po. ipasa nmn buwas po please​</p>

                                            We are all different as we come from different families that influenced us. You may have a small family with your father, mother and siblings while your friend has a big one which includes his/her relatives. There are also people who have a single parent only (mother or father only) and there are those that live with relatives only. Our family structure contributes to the way we act and think. It makes us unique and special. Despite that, we still have similarities that bind us. It would be helpful to focus on the common things that you have with other people to have a happy relationship with them. For instance, if you and your friend both like a toy car or love to eat guava, you can use that to spend time together. However, we need to respect and accept the things that other people have to still live a happy interaction with them.​</a>

Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</a>

                                             According to legend, there was a time
when the gods could live like ordinary
mortals do. Although these gods were
enchanted, they could speak, love, and
even go to the market like what people
do in our time. This story tells what
happened to the daughter of two such
deities. This is the story of Mariang
Makiling.
Two deities, Dayang Makiling and Gat Panahon, had an only
daughter named Maria. Because of her beauty and charm, she was
the delight of her parents. The source of their joy and strength,
Maria was, to them, a jewel, a treasure that made life full of light
and laughter. At that time people could talk with the deities face to
face, and even sit with them side by side underneath a tree. People
could also ask for help when they were in need, provided that they
asked in a solemn manner. It was the custom of Maria to go to a
small market, sometimes called talipapa, on weekdays. Just like
other women, she would on such occasions wear clothes made of
silk and embroidered with flowers and wide stripes for this was the
fashion at that time. Maria had long, black abundant hair which she
usually decorated with pomelo flowers. When she went to the
market, her flowing hair would touch her ankles. As she passed
along, gallant men would bow their heads to signify their respect.
When Maria went to the market, she was always
accompanied by two Aetas, who served as her
servants. These two servants stayed close behind
Maria, and they both carried a basket each that
was full of golden ginger. These golden ginger
Maria would barter for such items needed for the
home. There was no money at that time, and
instead of buying, people bartered and exchanged
their goods for the things that they needed. On a
market day, the residents of the area are not the
only ones who would go to the talipapa.
Merchants and people from neighboring towns
would also go to the market.
One day, Gat Dula, the ruler of the kingdom
of Bay, came to the talipapa to while away
the hours. A piece of animal skin with fine
hair caught Gat Dula's eye and he reached
out to touch the fur. At the same moment,
Maria was also reaching towards the same
piece of animal skin and their shoulders
accidentally touched. Their eyes met and
Gat Dula bowed his head as a sign of
respect and apology. And Maria responded
with a shy smile as they parted from each
other's company. Since that first encounter,
Gat Dula often visited the talipapa but he
was not able to see Maria during these visits.
One day, he saw Maria at the very place
where they first met. He approached Maria
and greeted her and Maria responded with
a very sweet smile. That was the beginning
of their friendship which blossomed into
love as the months passed. As time
passed, the love affair between Gat Dula
and Maria came to be known to Gat
Panahon, Maria's father. Gat Panahon was
angry. Even Dayang Makiling, Maria's
mother, was distressed that her only
daughter was in love with a mortal.
Maria was then forbidden to go down to earth. Her
parents even took away from Maria the power of
enchantment which enabled a deity to look and act like
an ordinary mortal. But even though Maria and Gat Dula
could no longer meet physically, their love endured.
Maria continued to watch over Gat Dula. During a battle
with the army of Lakan Bunto, the ruler of a neighboring
kingdom who invaded the kingdom of Bay, Gat Dula did
not suffer a single wound due to the support of Maria's
enchantment. Unfortunately, Gat Dula's inability to see
Maria caused him to fall ill and die. Maria asked the
gods to give her the soul of Gat Dula and her request was granted

Its goal is to explore and bring out the various emotions and insights of the participants to uas concepts in the findings of the study.The results of this study have shown that single parents of school children face a lot of variouadversities in life. Financial and emotional adversities in taking care and supporting the needs of their childreare common dilemmas they stand against. Few single parents can successfully raise children alone, despite thesocial expectation that noncustodial parents (usually the father) should only be responsible for supplementafinancial support, while the custodial parent (usually the mother) takes on both parenting and economic roles(Goldscheider and Waite 1991). The behavior of children may also be affected by the separation of parents. Infact, according to a study, many fathers stop seeing their children regularly after the firs year of divorce. Thiscan cause children to act out from the hurt and lack of a positive male role model. Behavioral problems can alsooccur when single moms are working too hard, making it more difficult to manage discipline effectively (Welton,2015).Recommendations 5: pa helps po. ipasa nmn buwas po please​</h2><br />

You may have a small family with your father, mother and siblings while your friend has a big one which includes his/her relatives. There are also people who have a single parent only (mother or father only) and there are those that live with relatives only. Our family structure contributes to the way we act and think. It makes us unique and special. Despite that, we still have similarities that bind us. It would be helpful to focus on the common things that you have with other people to have a happy relationship with them. For instance, if you and your friend both like a toy car or love to eat guava, you can use that to spend time together.

Essay:</p><p>31-40. Long-Term Foster Placement: Long-term foster placement refers to a type of foster care arrangement where a child is placed with a foster family for an extended period of time, with the goal of providing a stable and nurturing family environment until the child reaches adulthood or achieves permanency through adoption, legal guardianship, or reunification with the biological parents. Long-term foster placement is usually considered when it is not possible for the child to be reunited with their biological family, and adoption or legal guardianship is not feasible. In long-term foster care, the foster parents take on a parental role and provide ongoing care, support, and guidance to the child as they grow and develop. The child becomes an integral part of the foster family, and the foster parents are responsible for meeting the child's physical, emotional, and developmental needs. Long-term foster placement aims to provide stability, continuity, and a sense of belonging to the child, and may continue until the child becomes an adult and is ready to transition to independent living.</p><p>41-50. Emergency Foster Care Process: Emergency foster care is a type of foster care placement that occurs when a child is removed from their home due to an immediate crisis or danger, such as abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and requires immediate placement in a safe and secure environment. The process of emergency foster care typically involves the following steps:</p><p></p><p>Removal of the child from their home by a child welfare agency or law enforcement in response to a crisis or danger.</p><p></p><p>Assessment of the child's immediate needs, including physical health, safety, and emotional well-being.</p><p></p><p>Identification of an available and qualified foster family who can provide emergency care for the child.</p><p></p><p>Placement of the child with the emergency foster family, usually on a temporary basis, while the situation with the biological family is assessed and a more permanent plan is developed.</p><p></p><p>Initial screening and orientation of the emergency foster family to ensure their ability to provide appropriate care for the child in crisis.</p><p></p><p>Provision of support services to the child and the emergency foster family, including medical care, counseling, and other necessary interventions.</p><p></p><p>Regular monitoring and supervision by the child welfare agency to ensure the child's well-being and safety in the emergency foster care placement.</p><p></p><p>Development of a case plan and permanency plan for the child, which may involve family reunification, adoption, legal guardianship, or other appropriate options, based on the best interests of the child. </p><p></p><p>Court involvement, including hearings and legal proceedings, to determine the child's legal status and permanency plan.</p><p></p><p>Transition planning for the child, including preparation for potential reunification with the biological family, adoption, or other permanent placement options, depending on the outcome of the case plan and the best interests of the child.</p><p></p><p>The process of emergency foster care is designed to provide immediate safety and care for children who are in crisis situations, while also addressing their physical, emotional, and developmental needs. It involves coordination among various stakeholders, including child welfare agencies, law enforcement, foster families, and the court system, to ensure the well-being and best interests of the child are prioritized throughout the process</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Between the ages of 4 and 7, children become very interested and ask a lot of questions, indicating that they are starting to use primitive reasoning. There is a resurgence of interest in logic and the need to understand why things are the way they are (Piaget, 1890).B. In a learning mechanism known as classical conditioning, a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a hitherto neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell) (Pavlov, 1897).C. Centration is the act of concentrating all of one's attention on one aspect or characteristic of a situation while ignoring all others (Piaget, 1890).D. The first stage of Erikson's (1950) theory focuses on how the parents or caregivers meet the infant's basic needs and how this relationship leads to trust or distrust.E. The Mozart effect is the idea that listening to classical music will temporarily improve IQ test scores on one section (Rauscher et al. 1993).F. Social learning theory is a learning and social behavior theory that argues that new habits can be learned by watching and imitating others (Bandura, 1971).G. Operant conditioning is a method of learning that uses incentives and punishments to motivate people to learn. This form of conditioning assumes that an action and a result, such as a reward or punishment, have a causal relationship that leads to learning (Skinner, 1938).H. The physiological need, according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (1954), is a term developed to clarify and cultivate the basis for motivation. The key physical prerequisite for human existence is this definition.I. Rather than describing intelligence as a single, general capacity, the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that human intelligence be divided into distinct "modalities of intelligence" (Gardner, 1983).FOR THE LAST HELP ME, I NEED TO SUMBIT THIS TODAY HOPE U CAN HELP ME​</h2><br />

                            19.  According to legend, there was a time
when the gods could live like ordinary
mortals do. Although these gods were
enchanted, they could speak, love, and
even go to the market like what people
do in our time. This story tells what
happened to the daughter of two such
deities. This is the story of Mariang
Makiling.
Two deities, Dayang Makiling and Gat Panahon, had an only
daughter named Maria. Because of her beauty and charm, she was
the delight of her parents. The source of their joy and strength,
Maria was, to them, a jewel, a treasure that made life full of light
and laughter. At that time people could talk with the deities face to
face, and even sit with them side by side underneath a tree. People
could also ask for help when they were in need, provided that they
asked in a solemn manner. It was the custom of Maria to go to a
small market, sometimes called talipapa, on weekdays. Just like
other women, she would on such occasions wear clothes made of
silk and embroidered with flowers and wide stripes for this was the
fashion at that time. Maria had long, black abundant hair which she
usually decorated with pomelo flowers. When she went to the
market, her flowing hair would touch her ankles. As she passed
along, gallant men would bow their heads to signify their respect.
When Maria went to the market, she was always
accompanied by two Aetas, who served as her
servants. These two servants stayed close behind
Maria, and they both carried a basket each that
was full of golden ginger. These golden ginger
Maria would barter for such items needed for the
home. There was no money at that time, and
instead of buying, people bartered and exchanged
their goods for the things that they needed. On a
market day, the residents of the area are not the
only ones who would go to the talipapa.
Merchants and people from neighboring towns
would also go to the market.
One day, Gat Dula, the ruler of the kingdom
of Bay, came to the talipapa to while away
the hours. A piece of animal skin with fine
hair caught Gat Dula's eye and he reached
out to touch the fur. At the same moment,
Maria was also reaching towards the same
piece of animal skin and their shoulders
accidentally touched. Their eyes met and
Gat Dula bowed his head as a sign of
respect and apology. And Maria responded
with a shy smile as they parted from each
other's company. Since that first encounter,
Gat Dula often visited the talipapa but he
was not able to see Maria during these visits.
One day, he saw Maria at the very place
where they first met. He approached Maria
and greeted her and Maria responded with
a very sweet smile. That was the beginning
of their friendship which blossomed into
love as the months passed. As time
passed, the love affair between Gat Dula
and Maria came to be known to Gat
Panahon, Maria's father. Gat Panahon was
angry. Even Dayang Makiling, Maria's
mother, was distressed that her only
daughter was in love with a mortal.
Maria was then forbidden to go down to earth. Her
parents even took away from Maria the power of
enchantment which enabled a deity to look and act like
an ordinary mortal. But even though Maria and Gat Dula
could no longer meet physically, their love endured.
Maria continued to watch over Gat Dula. During a battle
with the army of Lakan Bunto, the ruler of a neighboring
kingdom who invaded the kingdom of Bay, Gat Dula did
not suffer a single wound due to the support of Maria's
enchantment. Unfortunately, Gat Dula's inability to see
Maria caused him to fall ill and die. Maria asked the
gods to give her the soul of Gat Dula and her request was granted
