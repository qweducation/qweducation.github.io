The city government is trying its best to come up with ways to at least ease the traffic fever. First, number coding is enforced, based on the plate numbers of vehicles. Another help being tried is the truck ban for certain hours. Other solutions suggested is to drop the window driving in the coding scheme, to totally ban trucks at daytime. And to regulate the scale of cars and other vehicles. 17. Speakers contain magnets. Magnetism can damage floppy disks, hard drives, backup tapes, and even a few electronic devices.
