studied at Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1872 and obtained a
bachelor’s degree with highest honors in 1876. He studied medicine at
the University of Sto Tomas but had to stop because he felt the Filipino
students were being discriminated by their Dominican teachers. He
went to Madrid and studied at the Universidad Central de Madrid where
he finished his course in Philosophy and Letters in 1885 at the age of
24.
He died on December 30, 1896 in Manila at the age of thirty- five

Guiness Book of World Records. Marikina is in the northeast of Metro

country. Before becoming known for its shoes, Marikina was recognized
as a big producer of rice and vegetables. It was first inhabited by the
Augustinians in 1500, followed by the Jesuits in 1630. The town was
first called “Marquina,” after the Spanish governor-general Felix
Berenguer de Marquina; the name was changed to “Marikina” during
the American occupation in 1901. It became a city on December 8,
1996.

among the eleven children of Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso.
Rizal’s first teacher was his mother. He learned the alphabet from his
mother at the age of three and could read and write at the age of 5.He
studied at Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1872 and obtained a
bachelor’s degree with highest honors in 1876. He studied medicine at
the University of Sto Tomas but had to stop because he felt the Filipino
students were being discriminated by their Dominican teachers. He
went to Madrid and studied at the Universidad Central de Madrid where
he finished his course in Philosophy and Letters in 1885 at the age of
24.
He died on December 30, 1896 in Manila at the age of thirty- five
years old.

following protective measures: To stay home during coronavirus
pandemic to better control the pandemic. Maintain at least 1-meter
distance between yourself and others because when someone coughs,
sneezes, or speaks he/she sprays small liquid droplets from his/her
nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can
breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has
the disease. DOH also advises the people to practice frequent and
proper handwashing. Wash hands only with soap and water for at least
20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are

Guiness Book of World Records. Marikina is in the northeast of Metro
Manila and is currently one of the most competitive cities in the
country. Before becoming known for its shoes, Marikina was recognized
as a big producer of rice and vegetables. It was first inhabited by the
Augustinians in 1500, followed by the Jesuits in 1630. The town was
first called “Marquina,” after the Spanish governor-general Felix
Berenguer de Marquina; the name was changed to “Marikina” during
the American occupation in 1901. It became a city on December 8,
1996.
