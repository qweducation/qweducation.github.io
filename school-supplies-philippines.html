Enrollment in senior high school (SHS). which will comprise Grades 11 and 12, is expected to increase to 2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for the SHS program. This Policy Note does note does an initial assessment of the K to 12 programs effects on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the additional demand for places in SHSs.

DepEd Kto12 Program2.	School Rules and Regulation3.	The Philippine Political Structurepaki sagot plsssss​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The DepEd Kto12 Program is an educational reform program in the Philippines that aims to enhance the quality of education and prepare Filipino students for the demands of the 21st century. It is an expansion of the previous 10-year basic education curriculum to a 12-year program that includes Kindergarten, six years of elementary education, four years of junior high school, and two years of senior high school. The program focuses on providing students with a more holistic and relevant education, with a curriculum that includes academic, technical-vocational, and sports and arts tracks. It also aims to produce graduates who are better equipped to pursue higher education, entrepreneurship, or employment.</p><p></p><p>The DepEd Kto12 Program has been implemented in stages since 2011 and has faced various challenges, including inadequate facilities, teacher shortages, and curriculum gaps. However, it has also received support from various stakeholders, including the government, educators, parents, and students. The program has been seen as a step towards addressing the country's education system's shortcomings and ensuring that Filipino students are better prepared for the challenges of the future.</p><p></p><p>Source: https://www.deped.gov.ph/k-to-12/about-k-to-12/</p><p></p><p>2. School rules and regulations are essential in maintaining a safe and orderly learning environment for students. These rules may vary from school to school, but common examples include dress codes, attendance policies, disciplinary procedures, and academic standards. The primary purpose of school rules is to promote student welfare and academic success by establishing clear expectations for behavior and conduct. These rules help students develop responsibility, respect, and self-discipline, and ensure that they are able to focus on their studies without distraction or disruption.</p><p></p><p>However, the implementation of school rules and regulations should also take into account the unique needs and circumstances of individual students. It is important to consider the socio-economic background, culture, and beliefs of students to avoid discrimination or marginalization. Effective communication and collaboration between school administrators, teachers, parents, and students are also essential in ensuring that school rules are fair, reasonable, and consistently enforced.</p><p></p><p>Source: https://www.edutopia.org/article/why-rules-matter-school</p><p></p><p>3. The Philippine political structure is a democratic republic with a presidential system of government. The country's political system is governed by a written constitution, which sets out the powers and functions of the three branches of government: the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The president is the head of state and government, and is elected every six years through a popular vote. The legislative branch is composed of a bicameral congress, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The judicial branch is independent and is composed of various courts, including the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and Regional Trial Courts.</p><p></p><p>The Philippine political structure has undergone various changes and challenges throughout history, including periods of martial law and political instability. The country's political system has also been shaped by various cultural and social factors, including the influence of religion, ethnic diversity, and economic development. Despite these challenges, the Philippines has continued to uphold its democratic ideals, with a vibrant civil society, free press, and active citizen participation in governance.</p><p></p><p>Source: https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/philippines/</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Enrollment in senior high school (SHS). which will comprise Grades 11 and 12, is expected to increase to 2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for the SHS program.
