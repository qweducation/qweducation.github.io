                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) is an area in the Northwestern Pacific where PAGASA, the Philippgines' national meteorological agency monitors weather occurrences. Significant weather disturbances, specifically tropical cyclones, that enter or develop in the PAR are given Philippine-specific names.</p><p></p><p>2. While some areas are more prone to flooding than others, the establishment of flood warning systems near any major waterway or body of water provides critical information that can protect property and save lives.</p><p></p><p>3. Yellow means “caution”. Residents are advised to monitor the news for further updates. ... </p><p>Green means “go”. Go ahead and prepare for possible evacuation. ... </p><p>Red means “stop”. Better stop what you are doing now if PAGASA says your area is under a “red warning.” Evacuate.</p><p></p><p>4. When a typhoon is in PAR, it provides updates so people and concerned agencies will be alerted. ... It gives warning against natural calamities such as typhoons and floods affecting national safety and welfare. It also monitors water dam activities.</p><p></p><p>5. The effects of tropical cyclones include heavy rain, strong wind, large storm surges near landfall, and tornadoes. The destruction from a tropical cyclone, such as a hurricane or tropical storm, depends mainly on its intensity, its size, and its location.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

The Philippine archipelago which is surrounded by water, lies at the eastern rim of Pacific ocean, western of the equator and about 1,000 km from the Asia mainland.3. On August 9, 2012, PAGASA's color coded warning signals color green was changed to yellow such that the warning levels are now yellow, green, and red.4. A yellow alert is issued when downpours constitute an emergency. This is raised when observed rainfall is more than 30mm within one hour or if rainfall has continued for the past three hours and is more than 85mm.5. The first tropical cyclone of the year starts with the name beginning in letter A as in Auring.6. Mercury is one of the liquids very sensitive to changes temperature.7. Sendong brought hours of torrential rains in Mindanao.8. Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air.9. The acronym name for NDRRMC is National Danger Risk Reduction and Management Council.10. The red alert is raised in areas where rainfall is between  10mm and 35mm within one hour. Flooding is a definite threat in communities under the orange alert.PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE!

                            5. 1. How many 4-digit numbers can be formed from the digits 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 if repetition is not allowed?
2. In how many ways can seven people be seated on a sofa if it can only accommodate five people?

6. A zip code contains 4 digits from the digits 0 to 9. How many different zip codes can be made if no digit is used more than once and the first digit cannot be zero?
7. How many distinct permutations are there in the word 'Philippines?
8. How many ways can you order four blue, seven red, and five green chips? Note that chips of the same color are identical.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Since repetition is not allowed, the first digit can be chosen from 7 digits, the second from 6 digits, the third from 5 digits, and the fourth from 4 digits. Therefore, the number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed is 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 = 840.</p><p></p><p>2. If the sofa can only accommodate 5 people, then the number of ways to seat 7 people is the number of ways to choose 5 people from 7 and then arrange them on the sofa. This can be computed as 7 choose 5 multiplied by 5! (the number of ways to arrange 5 people). Therefore, the answer is 21 x 120 = 2,520.</p><p></p><p>3. Since the table is round, the first student can be seated in any of the 10 chairs. After the first student is seated, there are only 9 chairs left and 9 students to choose from. The second student can be seated in any of the remaining 9 chairs, and so on. Therefore, the number of ways to seat the 10 students in a round table is 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 3,628,800.</p><p></p><p>4. There are 20 choices for the first placer, 19 choices for the second placer (since one participant has already won), and 18 choices for the third placer. Therefore, the number of ways to choose the winners is 20 x 19 x 18 = 6,840.</p><p></p><p>5. The boy president can be chosen in 15 ways, and the girl vice president can be chosen in 20 ways. There are 35 students left to choose from for the treasurer and the secretary. Therefore, the number of ways to choose the officers is 15 x 20 x 35 x 34 = 357,000.</p><p></p><p>6. There are 10 choices for the first digit (since zero cannot be chosen), 9 choices for the second digit (since one digit has already been used), 8 choices for the third digit, and 7 choices for the fourth digit. Therefore, the number of different zip codes that can be made is 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 = 5,040.</p><p></p><p>7. The word 'Philippines' has 11 letters, so there are 11 choices for the first letter, 10 choices for the second letter, and so on. However, since there are two P's, two H's, two I's, and two N's in the word, we need to divide by the factorials of the number of times each letter is repeated. Therefore, the number of distinct permutations is 11!/(2!2!2!2!) = 4,989,600.</p><p></p><p>8. The number of ways to order four blue chips is 1 (since they are identical), the number of ways to order seven red chips is 1 (since they are identical), and the number of ways to order five green chips is 1 (since they are identical). Therefore, the number of ways to order the chips is simply the product of these three numbers, which is 1 x 1 x 1 = 1.</p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps :))</p><br />
