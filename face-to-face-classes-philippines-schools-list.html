Sam’s Snail
One fine morning, a boy who goes by Sam was passing through the neighbourhood at 6:30 in the morning to make it to his school early. He was thinking about what the next class pet would be as the last one sadly died of thirst. 
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw a small snail upside-down on the sidewalk. He watched the snail struggle and try it’s best to get back up. Feeling sympathetic, he tipped it over. The snail continued on its way to the busy road. When Sam tried turning the snail around to make it face the grass, it still continued to the road.
Knowing the vehicles on the road could easily squish the puny snail, he decided to simply just bring it with him to school. He grabbed the empty container his mom always packs for him just in case and carefully placed the snail inside. He looked around and noticed a flower bush. He picked a leave and placed it in the container as well.
During class hours, he’d keep the snail’s container on top of his bag as it was full and he had to watch over the little critter. The adviser of his class made her students list down all the presidents of the Philippines they knew. As she was passing by her students, checking if everyone was working, she noticed the snail container on Sam’s bag and stared at it for a few seconds. 
“Sam, may I ask about this snail on top of your bag?” She asked him picking up the container in curiosity. “Teacher, that’s a snail I found going to school this morning, it had a huge risk of dying if he continued going to the busy road so I brought it to school to keep it safe.” Sam answered. “I see…may I speak to you after class?” She looked at him. “Sure ma’am.” Sam went back to listing presidents.
“Sam, I have questions regarding the snail. You know how no one brought a new class pet for us today right?” The teacher said as she pushed her glasses up her nose. “Yes po.” The adviser looked at him, “I would like to ask you if the snail could become the next class pet? We need a replacement for Tom the Tortoise. It’s fine if not.” He thought for a bit and asked himself “Why not?” “Sure teacher, we can make him the class pet.” The adviser’s eyes lit up and a smile crept on her face.
 “Great! Say, what is the name of the little fella?” She asked. “Eum, its name is…Shelly! Shelly the Snail.” Sam blurted out the first thing that came in mind. “Alright, I’ll bring it home and find a proper container for it.”
Since it was almost the end of the school year, Shelly ended up becoming their class pet until the last day of class. During it’s time as class pet, it became so popular it became the school’s new mascot! Who knew a snail found walking to school could achieve so much?</a>

Then, find the details with similar thoughts and their differences. NEWSPAPER: 748 private schools suspend operations By Janvic Mateo Hundreds of private elementary and high schools across the country will suspend operations this school year due to low enrollment of students, according to the Department of Education (DepEd). Data released this week by DepEd showed that 748 out of 14, 435 private schools nationwide have already given notice that they will not operate for school year 2020-2021. Most of those that will suspend operations are in Central Luzon with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila with 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspensions affect 3,233 teachers and 40,345 learners. DepEd reported that 329 are elementary schools, 18 are purely junior high school and 30 purely senior high school. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said low enrollment was the primary reason for not operating. He previously said that the cost of continuing operations under the blended learning setup was also a factor in the decision of some schools not to open this year. "(They are saying) that it would be temporary closure. But if the situation improves next year, they will reopen," he added. Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the rest of the year due to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted schools to adopt distance learning approaches, such as shifting to online or modular-based learning. Latest data showed that only 2.02 million students have so far enrolled in private schools, representing only 47.14 percent of the more than four million student population in private schools last year. More than 24.3 million elementary and high school students had expressed their intention to enroll in public and private schools this school year, representing 87.82 percent of the student population last year. Over 22.22 million signed up in public schools, while almost 400,000 students from private schools have transferred to public schools for the upcoming school year set to start Oct. 5. Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they are hopeful that the schools would reconsider their position, noting the improving economy that may push enrollment in the private sector.

ONLINE ARTICLE: 748 private schools suspend operation amid Covid-19 pandemic By Jasmine C. Posted on September 10, 2020 Metro Manila - Thousands of students and teachers across the country will be affected as hundreds of private elementary and high schools will be suspending its operation due to low enrollment of students. According to the data released by DepEd, 748 out of 14, 435 private schools across the country have sent their notice that they will temporarily suspend operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools in Central Luzon got the majority on the list with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila at 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspension will affect 40,345 and 3,233 teachers across the 329 elementary school with 18 junior high schools and 30 purely senior high schools. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said that low enrollment was the main culprit of the temporary suspension of operation. He added that the continuing operations under different learning setup was also a factor of some of the school not to open for the upcoming school year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, on the other hand, also attributed the temporary closure to lack of parent's income that leads to students of not enrolling for this school year. DepEd has allowed private schools to open its classes before October 5, provided that they will implement distance learning approach. Source: Jasmine C.

Sam’s Snail
One fine morning, a boy who goes by Sam was passing through the neighbourhood at 6:30 in the morning to make it to his school early. He was thinking about what the next class pet would be as the last one sadly died of thirst. 
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw a small snail upside-down on the sidewalk. He watched the snail struggle and try it’s best to get back up. Feeling sympathetic, he tipped it over. The snail continued on its way to the busy road. When Sam tried turning the snail around to make it face the grass, it still continued to the road.
Knowing the vehicles on the road could easily squish the puny snail, he decided to simply just bring it with him to school. He grabbed the empty container his mom always packs for him just in case and carefully placed the snail inside. He looked around and noticed a flower bush. He picked a leave and placed it in the container as well.
During class hours, he’d keep the snail’s container on top of his bag as it was full and he had to watch over the little critter. The adviser of his class made her students list down all the presidents of the Philippines they knew. As she was passing by her students, checking if everyone was working, she noticed the snail container on Sam’s bag and stared at it for a few seconds. 
“Sam, may I ask about this snail on top of your bag?” She asked him picking up the container in curiosity. “Teacher, that’s a snail I found going to school this morning, it had a huge risk of dying if he continued going to the busy road so I brought it to school to keep it safe.” Sam answered. “I see…may I speak to you after class?” She looked at him. “Sure ma’am.” Sam went back to listing presidents.
“Sam, I have questions regarding the snail. You know how no one brought a new class pet for us today right?” The teacher said as she pushed her glasses up her nose. “Yes po.” The adviser looked at him, “I would like to ask you if the snail could become the next class pet? We need a replacement for Tom the Tortoise. It’s fine if not.” He thought for a bit and asked himself “Why not?” “Sure teacher, we can make him the class pet.” The adviser’s eyes lit up and a smile crept on her face.
 “Great! Say, what is the name of the little fella?” She asked. “Eum, its name is…Shelly! Shelly the Snail.” Sam blurted out the first thing that came in mind. “Alright, I’ll bring it home and find a proper container for it.”
Since it was almost the end of the school year, Shelly ended up becoming their class pet until the last day of class. During it’s time as class pet, it became so popular it became the school’s new mascot! Who knew a snail found walking to school could achieve so much?</h2><br />

Then, find the details with similar thoughts and their differences. NEWSPAPER: 748 private schools suspend operations By Janvic Mateo Hundreds of private elementary and high schools across the country will suspend operations this school year due to low enrollment of students, according to the Department of Education (DepEd). Data released this week by DepEd showed that 748 out of 14, 435 private schools nationwide have already given notice that they will not operate for school year 2020-2021. Most of those that will suspend operations are in Central Luzon with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila with 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspensions affect 3,233 teachers and 40,345 learners. DepEd reported that 329 are elementary schools, 18 are purely junior high school and 30 purely senior high school. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said low enrollment was the primary reason for not operating. He previously said that the cost of continuing operations under the blended learning setup was also a factor in the decision of some schools not to open this year. "(They are saying) that it would be temporary closure. But if the situation improves next year, they will reopen," he added. Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the rest of the year due to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted schools to adopt distance learning approaches, such as shifting to online or modular-based learning. Latest data showed that only 2.02 million students have so far enrolled in private schools, representing only 47.14 percent of the more than four million student population in private schools last year. More than 24.3 million elementary and high school students had expressed their intention to enroll in public and private schools this school year, representing 87.82 percent of the student population last year. Over 22.22 million signed up in public schools, while almost 400,000 students from private schools have transferred to public schools for the upcoming school year set to start Oct. 5. Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they are hopeful that the schools would reconsider their position, noting the improving economy that may push enrollment in the private sector.

ONLINE ARTICLE: 748 private schools suspend operation amid Covid-19 pandemic By Jasmine C. Posted on September 10, 2020 Metro Manila - Thousands of students and teachers across the country will be affected as hundreds of private elementary and high schools will be suspending its operation due to low enrollment of students. According to the data released by DepEd, 748 out of 14, 435 private schools across the country have sent their notice that they will temporarily suspend operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools in Central Luzon got the majority on the list with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila at 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspension will affect 40,345 and 3,233 teachers across the 329 elementary school with 18 junior high schools and 30 purely senior high schools. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said that low enrollment was the main culprit of the temporary suspension of operation. He added that the continuing operations under different learning setup was also a factor of some of the school not to open for the upcoming school year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, on the other hand, also attributed the temporary closure to lack of parent's income that leads to students of not enrolling for this school year. DepEd has allowed private schools to open its classes before October 5, provided that they will implement distance learning approach. Source: Jasmine C.
