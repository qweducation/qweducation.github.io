                                            A. 
You are the customer support manager for a small software manufacturer. The newest addition to your 10-person team is Sofia, a recent college graduate. She is a little overwhelmed by the volume of calls, but is learning quickly and doing her best to keep up. Today, as you performed your monthly review of employee email, you were surprised to see that Sofia has received several messages from employment agencies. One message says, “Sofia, I’m sorry you don’t like your new job. We have lots of opportunities that I think would much better match your interests. Please call me, and let’s talk further.” You’re shocked and alarmed. You had no idea she was unhappy, and your team desperately needs her help to handle the onslaught of calls generated by the newest release of software. If you’re going to lose her, you’ll need to find a replacement quickly. You know that Sofia did not intend for you to see the email, but you can’t ignore what you saw. Should you confront Sofia and demand to know her intentions? Should you avoid any confrontation and simply begin seeking her replacement? Could you be misinterpreting the email? What should you do?
B. As part of your company’s annual performance review process, each employee must identify three coworkers to be interviewed by his manager to get a perspective on the employee’s overall work performance. Your friend has offered to give you a glowing performance review if you agree to do the same for him. Truth be told, your friend is not a very dependable worker, and his work is often below minimum standards. However, he is a good friend, and you would hate to upset him. What
would you do?

                            22. A. 
You are the customer support manager for a small software manufacturer. The newest addition to your 10-person team is Sofia, a recent college graduate. She is a little overwhelmed by the volume of calls, but is learning quickly and doing her best to keep up. Today, as you performed your monthly review of employee email, you were surprised to see that Sofia has received several messages from employment agencies. One message says, “Sofia, I’m sorry you don’t like your new job. We have lots of opportunities that I think would much better match your interests. Please call me, and let’s talk further.” You’re shocked and alarmed. You had no idea she was unhappy, and your team desperately needs her help to handle the onslaught of calls generated by the newest release of software. If you’re going to lose her, you’ll need to find a replacement quickly. You know that Sofia did not intend for you to see the email, but you can’t ignore what you saw. Should you confront Sofia and demand to know her intentions? Should you avoid any confrontation and simply begin seeking her replacement? Could you be misinterpreting the email? What should you do?
B. As part of your company’s annual performance review process, each employee must identify three coworkers to be interviewed by his manager to get a perspective on the employee’s overall work performance. Your friend has offered to give you a glowing performance review if you agree to do the same for him. Truth be told, your friend is not a very dependable worker, and his work is often below minimum standards. However, he is a good friend, and you would hate to upset him. What
would you do?
