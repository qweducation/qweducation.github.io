                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Henry Sy (Shoe Mart)</strong></p><p>Shoe Mart, or SM for short, is one of the country’s retail behemoths, and far more than just a mall. It is now a well-loved institution of which many Filipino families hold fond memories. It provides a wide range of services, including shopping, theatres, locations for date nights, parties and other special occasions, ice skating, and food courts. SM started modestly and from humble beginnings, despite its now upmarket reputation.</p><p></p><p> 2. <strong>Tony Tan Caktiong (Jollibee Foods)</strong></p><p>The cheerful tagline “langhap sarap” – a Jollibee trademark – is well-known among Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Socorro Ramos (National Book Store)</strong></p><p>Socorro Ramos began her career in publishing and retail as a salesgirl in a bookshop. With a capital of PHP200, she and her husband launched National Book Store in Escolta at the age of 19, selling books and school supplies to children. The Japanese imposed censorship on books and publications at the time, which included her burgeoning business. She and her husband supplemented their income by selling other products such as candles and soaps.</p><p></p><p>4. <strong>Edgar Sia (Mang Inasal)</strong></p><p>Edgar Sia, the brains behind Mang Inasal, is widely regarded as the Philippines’ pioneer in limitless rice meals</p><p></p><p>5. <strong>Mariano Que (Mercury Drug) </strong></p><p>Following WWII, Mariano Que discovered a commercial opportunity. Que, who had worked at a local drugstore before the war, opened his own drugstore when he noticed the demand for sulfa, a type of antibiotic used to treat bacterial illnesses. He began selling good-quality sulfa for a low price. As a result, he was able to expand his clientele. In 1945, he founded the Mercury Drug chain of pharmacies. Mercury Drug was named after the Roman god Mercury, who was known for his speed as well as for originating the medical industry’s symbol, the caduceus. He helped the company grow over time, and it is today one of the best-known drugstores in the country.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>#Carronlearning!<p></p><p>— pabrainliest :]</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>1. Andrew </strong><strong>Carnegie</strong><p></p>You probably recognize Andrew Carnegie’s name, since he’s one of the most famous and richest industrialists of all time. However, he didn’t accumulate his wealth as a result of formal education or a business-charged background. Instead, he dropped out of school at a young age and spent the major portion of his youth performing manual labor. He was a bobbin boy at a local cotton mill and then became a telegraph messenger. It wasn’t until he taught himself how to read and entered the railroad industry that he began to build the empire that would make him (and his family) a fortune.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>2. John Paul </strong><strong>DeJoria</strong><p></p>You may not have heard of John Paul DeJoria, but you’ve certainly indulged in some of the beauty products attached to his name. Now a multi-billionaire and one of the most accomplished entrepreneurs in modern history, DeJoria got his start as a newspaper courier. To make ends meet, he worked as a tow truck driver and a janitor. Eventually, he found his way to working at a hair-care company, where he met his future partner, Paul Mitchell. With minimal experience and a $700 loan, the duo founded a company now known as John Paul Mitchell Systems. From there, DeJoria co-founded Patron Spirits and the House of Blues.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>3. Harland </strong><strong>Sanders</strong><p></p>If someone asked you for a loan to start a restaurant, but had no formal culinary training or experience, would you make that loan? It seems crazy to think anyone could become a successful restauranteur without a background in the industry, but that’s exactly what Harlan “Colonel” Sanders was able to do. When he started his line of Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants, the only experience he had was cooking for his siblings as a child and working at a number of odd jobs.<p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>4. Joyce </strong><strong>Hall</strong><p></p>The founder of Hallmark Cards didn’t come from an extensive background of writing greeting cards, nor did he -- yes, this Joyce was a "he" -- have much experience as a businessman. Instead, he got his start selling perfume to his neighbors, then started a business wholesaling postcards to gift shops and bookstores. It was only after a fire destroyed most of his stock that he resorted to making his own cards. From there, he was able to launch a chain that made him millions.<p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>5. Jan </strong><strong>Koum</strong><p></p>Jan Koum doesn’t get as much press or attention as other tech company founders, but his story is both surprising and impressive. Koum immigrated to California with his family after leaving a small village in Ukraine. He didn’t have much of an education, but managed to teach himself the fundamentals of computer science in his spare time. When he was 18, despite his lack of formal education or training, he was able to attract the attention of Yahoo!, where he cut his teeth as an infrastructure engineer. After a few years working in the then-new computer industry, Koum saw the potential of creating his own app, and launched WhatsApp. In 2014, he sold it for $19 billion.<p></p><p>#nohate</p><p>#spreadlove</p><p>#needhelp333</p><br />
