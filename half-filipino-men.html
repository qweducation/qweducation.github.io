Then, write an essay (2-3 paragraphs) discussing the issues presented. You may include factual information to support your ideas. Please be guided by the rubric The Philippine government has been relatively successful in doing initiatives for the implementation of laws that look after the welfare of senior citizens. However , with the current COVID-19 crisis, there resurfaced unspoken issues that led to exacerbation of the conditions of vulnerable groups of the society including the aged group Many working senior citizens, especially those from the poor segment were estimated to have been deprved of their income because of the COVID-19. A result from the 2018 Longitudinal Study of Ageing and Health in the Philippines showed that 46 percent of the senior citizen population lives below the poverty line. The gender lens further disclosed that 57 percent of the men work as compared to 39 percent of the women within this aged group. Moreover, while 42 percent of the senior citizens have a pension, only half declared pension as their most essential income source with comparable levels for both men and women (Cruz et al., 2018). When translating these data to the current situation, it is evident that especially the very poor and women senior citizens would most likely be affected. Furthermore, there were also issues of senior citizens suffering from a scarcity of food and medicine as they lingered indoors during the COVID-19 quarantine. While the crisis administrators develop policies to address the basic needs of senior citizens, a substantial number of this vulnerable group has been barely surviving in circumstances made more unendurable by the quarantine (Binay, 2020) This condition is reflected in the words of a senior citizen who expressed in a media interview that since the quarantine, the government has offered not enough assistance. She mentioned needs such as medicines and face masks which she cannot afford. There were also instances when quarantine guidelines are unclear and caused confusion, making access to food and other basic commodities even more difficult (Paul, 2020). This challenging situation of senior citizens during the COVID-19 crisis is compounded by the inadequacy of living space for physical distancing Perez (2020) of the Commission on Population and Development analyzed the living space Filipinos have and whether physical distancing is possible. Basing on the statistics, it was found out that a​</a>

is greater stress on government and social programs, including
schools and healthcare systems.
22. Women still lag behind men in wages and top leadership positions 
held, although they are now more likely to attain a college degree.
23. Around the world, people are already noticing warmer winters, 
more severe storms and rainfall events, and more frequent 
wildfires.
24. The reports that the current population of 7.7 billion people is 
expected to grow in coming decades, with a projection of 8.5 billion 
people by 2030.

Geography for the Filipino is a small vague saying: matanda pa kay Mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall: the sarisari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate scratchings of each day: isang kahig, isang tuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the very smallest degree in retail: the tingi. (2) What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick cigarette, half a head garlic, a dab of hair pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things in carton or the dozen or the pound, and in large economy sizes, the exquisite transaction of Philippine tingi cannot be seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little! Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time or those grown-up men haunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns. Such folks are, obviously, not indolent, but not being indolent is just obviously, not enough. Laboriousness just can never be the equal of labor as skill, labor as audacity, labor as enterprise. (3) The Filipino who travels abroad gets to thinking that his is the hardest- working country in the world. By six or seven in the morning, we are already up and on our way to work, shops, and markets are open; the wheels of industry are already grinding.

Then, write an essay (2-3 paragraphs) discussing the issues presented. You may include factual information to support your ideas. Please be guided by the rubric The Philippine government has been relatively successful in doing initiatives for the implementation of laws that look after the welfare of senior citizens. However , with the current COVID-19 crisis, there resurfaced unspoken issues that led to exacerbation of the conditions of vulnerable groups of the society including the aged group Many working senior citizens, especially those from the poor segment were estimated to have been deprved of their income because of the COVID-19. A result from the 2018 Longitudinal Study of Ageing and Health in the Philippines showed that 46 percent of the senior citizen population lives below the poverty line. The gender lens further disclosed that 57 percent of the men work as compared to 39 percent of the women within this aged group. Moreover, while 42 percent of the senior citizens have a pension, only half declared pension as their most essential income source with comparable levels for both men and women (Cruz et al., 2018). When translating these data to the current situation, it is evident that especially the very poor and women senior citizens would most likely be affected. Furthermore, there were also issues of senior citizens suffering from a scarcity of food and medicine as they lingered indoors during the COVID-19 quarantine. While the crisis administrators develop policies to address the basic needs of senior citizens, a substantial number of this vulnerable group has been barely surviving in circumstances made more unendurable by the quarantine (Binay, 2020) This condition is reflected in the words of a senior citizen who expressed in a media interview that since the quarantine, the government has offered not enough assistance. She mentioned needs such as medicines and face masks which she cannot afford. There were also instances when quarantine guidelines are unclear and caused confusion, making access to food and other basic commodities even more difficult (Paul, 2020). This challenging situation of senior citizens during the COVID-19 crisis is compounded by the inadequacy of living space for physical distancing Perez (2020) of the Commission on Population and Development analyzed the living space Filipinos have and whether physical distancing is possible.

It also explores how this culture affects their laboriousness and enterprise.Foreigners are astonished by the fact that in the Philippines, people buy and sell small quantities of goods such as one stick cigarette, half a head of garlic, a dab of hair pomade, or one single egg, banana, or any other item. This transaction is known as "tingi," which is the smallest degree in retail.Based on the text, a Filipino thinks that his country is a hard-working one when they compare it to other countries where shops and markets open later in the morning, and activity doesn't begin until nine or ten, and promptly ends at five P.M. in the Western countries.<br />
