                                            DConvergent Plate BoundaryWhen continental and oceanic plates collide, the thinner and denser oceanic plate is overridden by the thicker and less dense continental plate. The oceanic plate is forced down into the mantle in a process known as "subduction." As the oceanic plate descends, it is forced into higher temperature environments. At a depth of about 100 miles (160 km), materials in the subducting plate begin to approach their melting temperatures and a process of partial melting begins.When a convergent boundary occurs between two oceanic plates, one of those plates will subduct beneath the other. Normally the older plate will subduct because of its higher density. The subducting plate is heated as it is forced deeper into the mantle, and at a depth of about 100 miles (150 km) the plate begins to melt. Magma chambers are produced as a result of this melting, and the magma is lower in density than the surrounding rock material. It begins ascending by melting and fracturing its way through the overlying rock material. Magma chambers that reach the surface break through to form a volcanic eruption cone. In the early stages of this type of boundary, the cones will be deep beneath the ocean surface but later grow to be higher than sea level. This produces an island chain. With continued development the islands grow larger, merge, and an elongate landmass is created.Learning Task 1: Read and study the different types of plate boundaries. Answer the questions that follow after the discussion of the contents on plate boundaries. Divergent Plate BoundaryWhen a divergent boundary occurs beneath oceanic lithosphere, the rising convection current below lifts the lithosphere, producing a mid-ocean ridge. Extensional forces stretch the lithosphere and produce a deep fissure. When the fissure opens, pressure is reduced on the super-heated mantle material below. It responds by melting, and the new magma flows into the fissure. The magma then solidifies and the process repeats itself.1. What process occurs along divergent plate boundary?2. What geologic features formed when two plates moved away from each  other?3. Compare rift valley from mid-ocean ridge. Explain your answer.Transform plate boundaryTransform Plate Boundaries are locations where two plates slide past one another. The fracture zone that forms a transform plate boundary is known as a transform fault. Most transform faults are found in the ocean basin and connect offsets in the mid-ocean ridges. A smaller number connect mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones.Transform faults can be distinguished from the typical strikeslip faults because the sense of movement is in the opposite direction (see illustration). A strike-slip fault is a simple offset; however, a transform fault is formed between two different plates, each moving away from the spreading center of a divergent plate boundary. When you look at the transform fault diagram, imagine the double line as a divergent plate boundary and visualize which way the diverging plates would be moving.Questions: 1. What process occurs along transform fault plate boundary?2. How do plate boundaries become transform fault?3. Why transform fault is occurs in lithosphere?​</a>

                            14. DConvergent Plate BoundaryWhen continental and oceanic plates collide, the thinner and denser oceanic plate is overridden by the thicker and less dense continental plate. The oceanic plate is forced down into the mantle in a process known as "subduction." As the oceanic plate descends, it is forced into higher temperature environments. At a depth of about 100 miles (160 km), materials in the subducting plate begin to approach their melting temperatures and a process of partial melting begins.When a convergent boundary occurs between two oceanic plates, one of those plates will subduct beneath the other. Normally the older plate will subduct because of its higher density. The subducting plate is heated as it is forced deeper into the mantle, and at a depth of about 100 miles (150 km) the plate begins to melt. Magma chambers are produced as a result of this melting, and the magma is lower in density than the surrounding rock material. It begins ascending by melting and fracturing its way through the overlying rock material. Magma chambers that reach the surface break through to form a volcanic eruption cone. In the early stages of this type of boundary, the cones will be deep beneath the ocean surface but later grow to be higher than sea level. This produces an island chain. With continued development the islands grow larger, merge, and an elongate landmass is created.Learning Task 1: Read and study the different types of plate boundaries. Answer the questions that follow after the discussion of the contents on plate boundaries. Divergent Plate BoundaryWhen a divergent boundary occurs beneath oceanic lithosphere, the rising convection current below lifts the lithosphere, producing a mid-ocean ridge. Extensional forces stretch the lithosphere and produce a deep fissure. When the fissure opens, pressure is reduced on the super-heated mantle material below. It responds by melting, and the new magma flows into the fissure. The magma then solidifies and the process repeats itself.1. What process occurs along divergent plate boundary?2. What geologic features formed when two plates moved away from each  other?3. Compare rift valley from mid-ocean ridge. Explain your answer.Transform plate boundaryTransform Plate Boundaries are locations where two plates slide past one another. The fracture zone that forms a transform plate boundary is known as a transform fault. Most transform faults are found in the ocean basin and connect offsets in the mid-ocean ridges. A smaller number connect mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones.Transform faults can be distinguished from the typical strikeslip faults because the sense of movement is in the opposite direction (see illustration). A strike-slip fault is a simple offset; however, a transform fault is formed between two different plates, each moving away from the spreading center of a divergent plate boundary. When you look at the transform fault diagram, imagine the double line as a divergent plate boundary and visualize which way the diverging plates would be moving.Questions: 1. What process occurs along transform fault plate boundary?2. How do plate boundaries become transform fault?3. Why transform fault is occurs in lithosphere?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) Along the third type of plate boundary, two plates move laterally and pass each other along giant fractures in Earth's crust. The majority of transform faults link the offset segments of oceanic ridges. .</p><p>2.) The third type of plate boundary is the transform fault, where plates slide past one another without the production or destruction of crust. Because rocks are cut and displaced by movement in opposite direction, rocks facing each other on two sides of the fault are typically of different type and age.</p><p>3.) This is due to the plates moving parallel with each other and no new lithosphere is being created to change that length. ... These occur when two descending subduction plates are linked by a transform fault.</p><br />
