                                            As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to strike pain on small and large businesses, thousands  of enterprises are closing down that affects millions of workers.
Camille Jazul-Salita, 28, beauty adviser in Qatar Airways, is one those Filipino overseas who came home. She was planning to resign in August but she did it earlier because of the COVID. Jazul Salita quips that she plans to enroll in a baking class at a state-owned technical school while she is here in the Philippines (Tadalan, 2020).
In today's difficult times, planning is essential to the success of any business. When a company bus plan to follow, it is ready to face the future. As Book of Luke chapter 14 verse 28 says “Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?"
 If you were Jazul-Salita, are you going to open a small business amidst this crisis? How will you manage the cost of your small venture?</a>

                                            NEW NORMAL
  The pandemic that the world is experiencing at the moment has affected the lives of people all over the world. The economy has been injured and jobs have been lost. Slowly, the world is trying to recover by transitioning into what we call the “NEW NORMAL” Countries like the Philippines is trying to recover by pushing on the continuance of economic activities. Businesses are allowed to open again adapting new policies.
PROCESSING QUESTIONS:
1. Since a lot of people have lost their jobs, how can corporations help the government in terms of their corporate social responsibility in the new normal?
2. How important is job creation during the implementation of the new normal in business?  </a>

It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset. A jeepney is hardly a jeepney without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an i of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not o They are allusive, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, D a severe Keep Distance.

Text Selection 1 The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity by Carmen Guerrero Nakpil 82 no one could do Bailey bridge, as insolent than the jeepney, If one were looking for a symbol of postwar Philippines, c y, which is as abundant and as persistent as postwar mosquitoes, as noisy and dangerous as postwar politics, as useful as a b as a squatter, and as much a creature of improvisation as the postwar Filipino. de a shop on an army jeep. It holds, in addition to its driver, from six to ten passengers and the most esoteric decorating job on wheels. Its body juts out way made body the asphalt. It looks just as crowded when it is carrying four as when it is carrying behind the original chassis and when fully loaded its rear lists perilously close twelve people - as it often does when business is good. Foreigners who come to Manila for the first time stare in disbelief at the fleets of jeepneys which swarm like a plague of locusts all over the city. They swear they have never seen anything quite like them. Indeed, no one who has become used to thinking of the army jeep as a drab, olive-colored drudge would recognize it on the streets of Manila in its reincarnation as the flamboyant Filipino jeepney. The man, who named the jeep the general-purpose vehicle, could never have imagined the possibilities that have now been unfolded by the Filipino jeepney. Not even the creator of the army jeep would recognize it now. Its staid radiator front hides behind a magnificent nickel-plated gird, lifted perhaps from a Cadillac or a Ford, or devised by some ingenious tin-smith to look like a dragon's maw. Its hood, now painted in a rhapsody of unexpected colors, rumbles menacingly beneath a figure-flying fish; its mudguards have been redesigned and now leap forward audaciously beneath twin quavering antennae bearing pompoms of varicolored plastic. The original canvas top no longer flaps about in tent-like simplicity. It reposes on a curved structure, like a shallow dome of welded iron, as proud as the marquee of a stylish hotel, fringed and lined with plastic leatherette The jeep's square body has become a quaint carriage as open as a verandah and as gay as a movie house. A railing of fretted metal runs down each side ending in two handle-bars of a design which another age called "modernistic" and which hamper rather than aid the descent and ascent of passengers at the rear steps. rest of the jeepney is painted in a characteristic design rendered in unpredictable color combinations which can best be described as Oriental baroque; whorls, lines stylized wings and shells are fluted and convoluted in geometrical precision and The bemuse the eye like a Manila Bay sunset. A jeepney is hardly a jeepney without its painted signs. Beneath the windshield the lettering may read Divisoria-Mahal Ko-Pasig or Manila and Suburbs-Heart and Soul. At the side is inscribed the name of the operator and an i of the passenger capacity. On the steps are more letters: a flirtatious Kiss Me Not o They are allusive, inspirational or romantic, being taken from movie titles, D a severe Keep Distance. Jeepney signs are extremely responsive to fad and fashion imaginative estimat the C C.1. Who is Carmen Guerrero Nakpil?2. How did the author describe jeepney?3. What does the jeepney symbolized?4.

                        1. Carmen Guerrero Nakpil is the author of the text "The Jeepney - A Product of Filipino Ingenuity."<br /><br />2. The author described the jeepney as a flamboyant, abundantly decorated vehicle that is noisy, crowded, and dangerous. It can carry six to ten passengers, and sometimes up to twelve, and is a creature of improvisation and ingenuity.<br /><br />3. The jeepney symbolizes postwar Philippines, with its abundance, persistence, usefulness, and improvisation. It is a product of Filipino ingenuity and resourcefulness, and a reflection of the country's history and culture.<br /><br />4. The text does not provide a direct answer to this question, but it does highlight the jeepney's usefulness, creativity, and cultural significance.<br /><br />5. As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases. However, the proposed phase-out of jeepneys is a controversial issue that has sparked debates and protests in the Philippines. Supporters argue that it is necessary to modernize the public transportation system and reduce air pollution, while critics argue that it will displace thousands of drivers and harm small businesses.<br />
