Pedro : Father

Gardo : Eldest son (20 yrs. old)
Efren : Son in Manila (17 yrs. old)
Ninay : Youngest daughter (12 yrs. old)
Delia : Another daughter (15 yrs. old)
Iking : Mailman
Iking : Good morning, is anybody home?
Ninay : Good morning, Mang Iking!
Iking : Oh, Ninay! I didn’t see you right away.
Ninay : I was standing behind the bushes. That is why you didn’t see me. Is there any letter for us, Mang Iking?
Iking : Yes. Here’s a letter for your father. It must be from your brother Efren. It came from Manila. Here. Take it.
Ninay : Thank you, Mang Iking. I will give this to Father. I’m sure he will be glad to receive news from Kuya Efren. He has been away for more than a month already and we miss him very much.
Iking : He is now studying in Manila, isn’t he?
Ninay : Yes. He wants to be an engineer and I’m sure he will be someday!
Iking : Alright, I have to leave now. I still have a lot of letters to deliver. Goodbye, Ninay.
Ninay
Later. . . : Goodbye, Mang Iking. Thank you again!
Ninay : Mother asked me to bring your lunch, Father.
Pedro : Where is she? I thought she’d bring lunch herself.
Ninay : Ka Tonyo fetched her. His wife is about to give birth. And they need mother to help deliver the baby. Where’s Kuya Gardo? Isn’t he with you?
Pedro : He went to the stream to get some water. Here he comes now.
Ninay : I really must leave now or I will be late for school, Father.
Pedro : Then better hurry along. Be careful, though.
Ninay : Yes, I will be careful. Oh, I almost forgot!
Pedro : What?
Ninay : I have a letter here for you. Mang Iking gave it to me. Here, Father.
Ninay : Goodbye.
Gardo : Shall we eat now, Father?
Pedro : Later, Gardo. Read this letter to me first because I left my reading glasses at home.
Gardo : This must have come from Efren.
Pedro : How do you know?
Efren : “... and I want so much to go back home. The only thing that sustains me in my loneliness is the thought that someday, I will be able to help you lift our family from the poverty we have endured for so long. I shall always be grateful to you, Father.”
Efren : “Please give my love to Mother, Delia, Ninay and Kuya Gardo. You are always on my mind and in my heart...”
Sepa : “. . . Efren.” He is such a good son.
Pedro : Yes. (softly) Efren is a good son, Sepa.
Sepa : Now, tell me why you were angry when you came home from the fields, Pedro. Do you have a problem?
Pedro : Problem? Oh, no. I don’t have a problem. Let’s just say that there was a little miscommunication earlier. But that has been corrected now.

At last, he is now back home after seven years. He graduated as a civil engineer from a famous University in Manila, passed the board exam and was hired as a consultant in a big construction company. Engineer Armando Corpuz- the first one on their remote barangay. His parents and two brothers sacrificed a lot for him and they succeeded. Now, it is time for him to return the favor. He will finance the studies of his two younger brothers in any private school they want. He will build a big concrete house for their family and give them a big amount of money for them to start any business. Ahh! God is very good to them for their faith and perseverance. 1.

Iking : Good morning, is anybody home?
Ninay : Good morning, Mang Iking!
Iking : Oh, Ninay! I didn’t see you right away.
Ninay : I was standing behind the bushes. That is why you didn’t see me. Is there any letter for us, Mang Iking?
Iking : Yes. Here’s a letter for your father. It must be from your brother Efren. It came from Manila. Here. Take it.
Ninay : Thank you, Mang Iking. I will give this to Father. I’m sure he will be glad to receive news from Kuya Efren. He has been away for more than a month already and we miss him very much.
Iking : He is now studying in Manila, isn’t he?
Ninay : Yes. He wants to be an engineer and I’m sure he will be someday!
Iking : Alright, I have to leave now. I still have a lot of letters to deliver. Goodbye, Ninay.
Ninay
Later. . . : Goodbye, Mang Iking. Thank you again!
Ninay : Mother asked me to bring your lunch, Father.
Pedro : Where is she? I thought she’d bring lunch herself.
Ninay : Ka Tonyo fetched her. His wife is about to give birth. And they need mother to help deliver the baby. Where’s Kuya Gardo? Isn’t he with you?
Pedro : He went to the stream to get some water. Here he comes now.
Ninay : I really must leave now or I will be late for school, Father.
Pedro : Then better hurry along. Be careful, though.
Ninay : Yes, I will be careful. Oh, I almost forgot!
Pedro : What?
Ninay : I have a letter here for you. Mang Iking gave it to me. Here, Father.
Ninay : Goodbye.
Gardo : Shall we eat now, Father?
Pedro : Later, Gardo. Read this letter to me first because I left my reading glasses at home.
Gardo : This must have come from Efren.
Pedro : How do you know?
Efren : “... and I want so much to go back home. The only thing that sustains me in my loneliness is the thought that someday, I will be able to help you lift our family from the poverty we have endured for so long. I shall always be grateful to you, Father.”
Efren : “Please give my love to Mother, Delia, Ninay and Kuya Gardo. You are always on my mind and in my heart...”
Sepa : “. . . Efren.” He is such a good son.
Pedro : Yes. (softly) Efren is a good son, Sepa.
Sepa : Now, tell me why you were angry when you came home from the fields, Pedro. Do you have a problem?
Pedro : Problem? Oh, no. I don’t have a problem. Let’s just say that there was a little miscommunication earlier. But that has been corrected now.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The letter is from Efren, the son who is studying in Manila, and it contains his message of love and gratitude towards his family, particularly his father who has endured poverty for so long.The eldest son, Gardo, interpreted the letter positively and with a proud tone of voice. He was not jealous of his brother and instead, he seemed to admire Efren's dedication to his studies and his desire to help lift their family from poverty.The mother, Sepa, interpreted the letter with a loving and emotional tone of voice. She expressed her admiration for Efren's character and considered him a good son. While not all mothers may react in the same way, it is common for parents to feel proud and emotional when receiving messages from their children who are away from home.Both interpretations are valid and can be considered close to Efren's intention. The letter expresses Efren's love and gratitude towards his family, as well as his determination to succeed and help his family overcome poverty. It is possible that Efren intended to convey both the positive emotions and the message of hope for a better future that his family can have with his success.Both interpretations are likable, as they show different perspectives and emotions that can arise from reading a letter from a loved one who is far away. However, the interpretation that focuses on Efren's determination to succeed and help his family can be particularly inspiring and hopeful for others who may also be struggling with poverty or other challenges in their lives.<p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>google nyo po para malaman mo</p><br />
