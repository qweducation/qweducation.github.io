                                            Evaluating Ethical Standard in Writing In the Philippines, there are countless of professional journalists. However, due to various circumstances, there are journalists who violate the code of ethics. These violations in accordance with the Journalists’ Code of Ethics are considered as forms of misconduct. Here is the example: Situation: The article published by TJ Burgonio, from the Philippine Daily Inquirer, last April 20, 2013. PDI published on its front page and online edition a fake cover of Time Magazine with President Benigno Aquino III. The Inquirer caption said: “President Aquino on TIME Magazine cover: I’m just the face of the whole country.” Question: What is the violation that the journalist did based from the Journalist’s Code of Ethics? Answer: If we will analyze this case, what PDI did was unethical and indeed a violation of Article 1 of the Filipino Journalists’ Code of Ethics. It was clear that the information gathered in the article was not carefully verified and fact-checked. As a journalist, Burgonio must be really careful in verifying information ACTIVITY: Read the situation below and analyze the what code of ethics did the journalist violate. Question: Identify what code of ethics did the following situation violated and discuss your answer. Situation 1: The article published by Alfred Yuson, from the Philippine Star, last April 18, 2011. Yuson’s published article on Rogue Magazine regarding the Philippine Basketball Association and its former commissioner Rudy Salud contained paragraphs copied/lifted word for word from Rey Joble’s report on the same topic for GMA News Online. It was found out by blogger Jaemark Tordecilla, in his sports blog “Fire Quinito”. Yuson wrote Tordecilla an e-mail to explain why he committed the mistake. Situation 2: In the caption of the photograph on the cover page of the Philippine Daily Inquirer last May 9, 2012, whereas President Benigno S. Aquino III shaking hands with an unidentified Muslim woman in a burqa. Below the photograph, there was a caption, “SECURITY RISK? President Aquino greets a Muslim woman wrapped in a burka and niqab during the oath-taking of officers in charge of the ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly held in Malacañang on Tuesday.​</a>

Esplanada - @inquirerdotnetPhilippine Daily Inquirer / 03:42 AM August 20, 2015HAPPY 137TH, MLQ President Aquino gently leads Zenaida Quezon Avanceña, President Manuel L. Quezon’s daughter, into the Quezon museum on Elliptical Road, Quezon City. The “Museo ni Manuel L. Quezon” at Quezon Memorial Shrine was inaugurated Wednesday in time for the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, the president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 1935 to 1944. PHOTO BY AURO MONTELLANO JR. AND GIL NARTEA/MALACAÑANG PHOTO BUREAUBetter late than never.The late President Manuel L. Quezon has been finally recognized for his “open door” policy during the Commonwealth period, which allowed the entry into the country of more than 1,300 Jewish refugees fleeing the horrors of Nazism under then German leader Adolf Hitler.During simple rites at Quezon Memorial Circle, the Philippine leader was awarded Wednesday the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation (RWF) Medal for his “life-saving plan” and for “reaching out to the victims of the Nazi murderous machine.”Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who saved an undisclosed number of Jews and persecuted people in Hungary during the Holocaust. His death while under Soviet captivity has been the subject of controversy.Internet connection problem cuts off Palace briefing on telco servicesThe medal was handed to Ma. Zenaida “Nini” Quezon Avanceña, daughter of Quezon, by Effie Ben-Matityau, Israel’s ambassador to the Philippines, and Lee Blumenthal, board member of the Jewish Association of the Philippines.President Aquino and other government officials attended the ceremony at the newly renovated Quezon Museum, which was formerly the Quezon ancestral home in New Manila, Quezon City. It was transported piece by piece to Quezon Memorial Circle.Monumental projectIn a statement, the RWF said Quezon’s “original life-saving plans were more ambitious and far reaching.”“In fact, he wanted to absorb some 100,000 Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe. However, his monumental project was thwarted by the outbreak of World War II and the Japanese invasion of the Philippines.”The group, which has offices in Jerusalem, Buenos Aires and New York, cited Quezon for epitomizing the “spirit of civic courage and solidarity exemplified by Raoul Wallenberg and all the men and women who reached out to the Nazi victims.”The RWF noted that “more than 300 heads of state, Nobel Prize laureates and distinguished personalities from all walks of life are honorary members of the foundation.”“One of the first to join its ranks was the then Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Mario Bergoglio, better known today as Pope Francis,” it added.The RWF event coincided with the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, described by Malacañang as “one of the many Filipinos who not only dedicated their careers to service but also led a life worthy of example.”“His accomplishments as a statesman include the ratification of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which led to Philippine self-government and eventual independence from the United States. Also among his legacies are his advocacy of women’s suffrage and the institutionalization of Filipino as our national language,” the Palace said.It added that Quezon’s “beliefs on the importance of moral and civic virtue are encapsulated in his Code of Citizenship and Ethics.”​</a>

                            2. Evaluating Ethical Standard in Writing In the Philippines, there are countless of professional journalists. However, due to various circumstances, there are journalists who violate the code of ethics. These violations in accordance with the Journalists’ Code of Ethics are considered as forms of misconduct. Here is the example: Situation: The article published by TJ Burgonio, from the Philippine Daily Inquirer, last April 20, 2013. PDI published on its front page and online edition a fake cover of Time Magazine with President Benigno Aquino III. The Inquirer caption said: “President Aquino on TIME Magazine cover: I’m just the face of the whole country.” Question: What is the violation that the journalist did based from the Journalist’s Code of Ethics? Answer: If we will analyze this case, what PDI did was unethical and indeed a violation of Article 1 of the Filipino Journalists’ Code of Ethics. It was clear that the information gathered in the article was not carefully verified and fact-checked. As a journalist, Burgonio must be really careful in verifying information ACTIVITY: Read the situation below and analyze the what code of ethics did the journalist violate. Question: Identify what code of ethics did the following situation violated and discuss your answer. Situation 1: The article published by Alfred Yuson, from the Philippine Star, last April 18, 2011. Yuson’s published article on Rogue Magazine regarding the Philippine Basketball Association and its former commissioner Rudy Salud contained paragraphs copied/lifted word for word from Rey Joble’s report on the same topic for GMA News Online. It was found out by blogger Jaemark Tordecilla, in his sports blog “Fire Quinito”. Yuson wrote Tordecilla an e-mail to explain why he committed the mistake. Situation 2: In the caption of the photograph on the cover page of the Philippine Daily Inquirer last May 9, 2012, whereas President Benigno S.

                            8. Plagiarism should not be tolerated as the unauthorized use of original ideas and works constitutes a violation of intellectual property rights. According to Wipo (2004). Intellectual Property refers to the creations of the mind: inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names and images used in commerce. In the Philippines, intellectual property is protected by the Republic Act 8293l or the Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines.Following are the provisions of the Code regarding published works:"Published works" means works, which, with the consent of the authors, are made available to the public by wire or wireless means in such a way that members of the public may access these works from a place and time individually chosen by them: Provided, that availability of such copies has been such, as to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the public, having regard to the nature of the work.QUESTION:Have you encountered instances where someone violated RA 8293? If yes, how would you rectify the situation? If no, how will you follow this law in your research writing?​</h2><br />
                        <p>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>.Yes, I have encountered instances where someone violated RA 8293, also known as the Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines. In some cases, I have seen individuals using copyrighted materials without permission or proper attribution, which is a clear violation of the law. To rectify such situations, I would advise the individual to seek permission from the rightful owner of the material or provide proper attribution. If the violation is severe, legal action may be necessary. On the other hand, if I have not encountered any instances of RA 8293 violation in my research writing, I will ensure that I follow the law by obtaining proper permission and giving proper attribution for any copyrighted materials used in my work. This is important not only to avoid legal consequences but also to uphold the principles of intellectual property rights and respect for the work of others.</p><br />

Esplanada - @inquirerdotnetPhilippine Daily Inquirer / 03:42 AM August 20, 2015HAPPY 137TH, MLQ President Aquino gently leads Zenaida Quezon Avanceña, President Manuel L. Quezon’s daughter, into the Quezon museum on Elliptical Road, Quezon City. The “Museo ni Manuel L. Quezon” at Quezon Memorial Shrine was inaugurated Wednesday in time for the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, the president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 1935 to 1944. PHOTO BY AURO MONTELLANO JR. AND GIL NARTEA/MALACAÑANG PHOTO BUREAUBetter late than never.The late President Manuel L. Quezon has been finally recognized for his “open door” policy during the Commonwealth period, which allowed the entry into the country of more than 1,300 Jewish refugees fleeing the horrors of Nazism under then German leader Adolf Hitler.During simple rites at Quezon Memorial Circle, the Philippine leader was awarded Wednesday the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation (RWF) Medal for his “life-saving plan” and for “reaching out to the victims of the Nazi murderous machine.”Wallenberg was a Swedish diplomat who saved an undisclosed number of Jews and persecuted people in Hungary during the Holocaust. His death while under Soviet captivity has been the subject of controversy.Internet connection problem cuts off Palace briefing on telco servicesThe medal was handed to Ma. Zenaida “Nini” Quezon Avanceña, daughter of Quezon, by Effie Ben-Matityau, Israel’s ambassador to the Philippines, and Lee Blumenthal, board member of the Jewish Association of the Philippines.President Aquino and other government officials attended the ceremony at the newly renovated Quezon Museum, which was formerly the Quezon ancestral home in New Manila, Quezon City. It was transported piece by piece to Quezon Memorial Circle.Monumental projectIn a statement, the RWF said Quezon’s “original life-saving plans were more ambitious and far reaching.”“In fact, he wanted to absorb some 100,000 Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe. However, his monumental project was thwarted by the outbreak of World War II and the Japanese invasion of the Philippines.”The group, which has offices in Jerusalem, Buenos Aires and New York, cited Quezon for epitomizing the “spirit of civic courage and solidarity exemplified by Raoul Wallenberg and all the men and women who reached out to the Nazi victims.”The RWF noted that “more than 300 heads of state, Nobel Prize laureates and distinguished personalities from all walks of life are honorary members of the foundation.”“One of the first to join its ranks was the then Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Mario Bergoglio, better known today as Pope Francis,” it added.The RWF event coincided with the 137th birth anniversary of Quezon, described by Malacañang as “one of the many Filipinos who not only dedicated their careers to service but also led a life worthy of example.”“His accomplishments as a statesman include the ratification of the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which led to Philippine self-government and eventual independence from the United States. Also among his legacies are his advocacy of women’s suffrage and the institutionalization of Filipino as our national language,” the Palace said.It added that Quezon’s “beliefs on the importance of moral and civic virtue are encapsulated in his Code of Citizenship and Ethics.”​</h2><br />
