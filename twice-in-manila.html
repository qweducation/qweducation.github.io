Duterte’s father served as governor of the province of Davao, and his
mother was a community activist who had a prominent role in the “people power”
movement that deposed the authoritarian President Ferdinand Marcos and restored 
democratic rule to the Philippines. Duterte earned a Political
Science Degree (1968) from Lyceum of the Philippines University in Manila and a law degree 
(1972) from San Beda College. In 1977 , he joined the Davao
City Prosecutor’s Office, where he remained until he was appointed (1986) 
vice mayor of that city.
Duterte was elected mayor in 1988, and he was reelected to that post twice over 
the subsequent decade. Because of term -limit restrictions, he was barred from seeking 
reelection in 1998, but he successfully ran for a seat
representing Davao in the Philippines House of Representatives. Upon the
completion of that term in 2001, he returned to Davao City and was once more 
elected mayor. Because the term-limit restriction again came into force in 2010, 
he was elected vice mayor, and his daughter Sara served as mayor. I n 2013 
Duterte returned to the mayor’s office, this time with his son Paolo (“Pulong”)
serving as vice mayor.</a>

                                            introduction During the years of American colonialism and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Manuel Luis Quezon was arguably the most eminent and well-known pre-war Filipino leader. He was unmatched in his involvement in Philippine affairs during the years from 1907 until his death in 1944. Over the course of a career spanning the duration of American colonial authority in the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon possessed unrivaled knowledge of territorial politics, which culminated in his service as the Commonwealth's first president. Quezon originally fought against the United States during its invasion of the islands in the early 1900s, but with to the sheer force of his personality and natural political skill, he rapidly propelled himself into a Resident Commissioner post. He was young and brilliant politician, possessed "an ability and persistence rare and creditable to any representative in any parliament in the world," according to a political rival. In private meetings with the President and influential committee chairs, he assessed the problems and crafted legislative solutions that ultimately led to the "Jones Act of 1916," which is possibly his most cunning political triumph. Quezon was cautious of instant independence, but he worked extremely hard in the US House of Representatives to guarantee greater autonomy for his country. He once said, “Considering the time I have been here, the character of the subject, and the influences I had to fight, I feel inclined to say that I am almost surprised that I have secured so much”. Ever since he retired as a Resident Commissioner, he continued to mold the office by selecting and sometimes dismissing his appointees. Quezon was regarded as "bright but lazy," but he showed off his courageous, brash, and irritable combat style when he joined Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary forces during the revolution against Spain. Prior to turning himself in to the Americans in 1899, he was promoted from private to major. After serving six months in prison, he was released and sent back to Manila. Filipinos regard Quezon as the country's second President after Aguinaldo, despite the fact that Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary Republica Filipina was not recognized by other countries. Quezon is known as the "Father of the Republic of the Philippines" and the "Father of Filipino Independence" because of his efforts to encourage the Philippines' independence from the American administration. The Filipino people's peaceful suffrage has elevated him to that eminent position twice. When he speaks, he does so as more than just the official representative of his country. He speaks as the undisputed leader of a race that has pushed him to the top for the last two decades. make a reflection about this please I need this​</a>

After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist. I was attached to General MacArthur’s staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast.

I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was order to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan.

The second I was called upon to make considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convince that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president— started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration. Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, I was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramon Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. i could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself. Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, I left for the United States.​</a>

"This I Believe" by: Carlos P. Romulo
I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist.
I was attached to General Macarthur's staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called the Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was ordered to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan.
From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequences to my family. I did not see them again until after the liberation of my country by the American forces under General Macarthur, aided by the Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation.
The second time was called upon to make a considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during the 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convinced that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president. I founded a third party, the Democratic Party, and accepted the nomination for president-started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration.
Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they would present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramón Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. I could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself.
Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, left for the United States.
As look back, see this pattern of action and renunciation repeated over and over again in my life-in things great and small, in war and in peace. Some may call this a credo of self-sacrifice. I prefer to describe it as being true to one's self, no matter what the cost.</a>

Duterte’s father served as governor of the province of Davao, and his
mother was a community activist who had a prominent role in the “people power”
movement that deposed the authoritarian President Ferdinand Marcos and restored 
democratic rule to the Philippines. Duterte earned a Political
Science Degree (1968) from Lyceum of the Philippines University in Manila and a law degree 
(1972) from San Beda College. In 1977 , he joined the Davao
City Prosecutor’s Office, where he remained until he was appointed (1986) 
vice mayor of that city.
Duterte was elected mayor in 1988, and he was reelected to that post twice over 
the subsequent decade. Because of term -limit restrictions, he was barred from seeking 
reelection in 1998, but he successfully ran for a seat
representing Davao in the Philippines House of Representatives. Upon the
completion of that term in 2001, he returned to Davao City and was once more 
elected mayor. Because the term-limit restriction again came into force in 2010, 
he was elected vice mayor, and his daughter Sara served as mayor. I n 2013 
Duterte returned to the mayor’s office, this time with his son Paolo (“Pulong”)
serving as vice mayor.</h2><br />

                            7. introduction During the years of American colonialism and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Manuel Luis Quezon was arguably the most eminent and well-known pre-war Filipino leader. He was unmatched in his involvement in Philippine affairs during the years from 1907 until his death in 1944. Over the course of a career spanning the duration of American colonial authority in the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon possessed unrivaled knowledge of territorial politics, which culminated in his service as the Commonwealth's first president. Quezon originally fought against the United States during its invasion of the islands in the early 1900s, but with to the sheer force of his personality and natural political skill, he rapidly propelled himself into a Resident Commissioner post. He was young and brilliant politician, possessed "an ability and persistence rare and creditable to any representative in any parliament in the world," according to a political rival. In private meetings with the President and influential committee chairs, he assessed the problems and crafted legislative solutions that ultimately led to the "Jones Act of 1916," which is possibly his most cunning political triumph. Quezon was cautious of instant independence, but he worked extremely hard in the US House of Representatives to guarantee greater autonomy for his country. He once said, “Considering the time I have been here, the character of the subject, and the influences I had to fight, I feel inclined to say that I am almost surprised that I have secured so much”. Ever since he retired as a Resident Commissioner, he continued to mold the office by selecting and sometimes dismissing his appointees. Quezon was regarded as "bright but lazy," but he showed off his courageous, brash, and irritable combat style when he joined Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary forces during the revolution against Spain. Prior to turning himself in to the Americans in 1899, he was promoted from private to major. After serving six months in prison, he was released and sent back to Manila. Filipinos regard Quezon as the country's second President after Aguinaldo, despite the fact that Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary Republica Filipina was not recognized by other countries. Quezon is known as the "Father of the Republic of the Philippines" and the "Father of Filipino Independence" because of his efforts to encourage the Philippines' independence from the American administration. The Filipino people's peaceful suffrage has elevated him to that eminent position twice. When he speaks, he does so as more than just the official representative of his country. He speaks as the undisputed leader of a race that has pushed him to the top for the last two decades. make a reflection about this please I need this​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Use compound interest formulas</p><p>Savings instruments in which earnings are continually reinvested, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, use compound interest. The term compounding refers to interest earned not only on the original value, but on the accumulated value of the account.</p><p></p><p>The annual percentage rate (APR) of an account, also called the nominal rate, is the yearly interest rate earned by an investment account. The term nominal is used when the compounding occurs a number of times other than once per year. In fact, when interest is compounded more than once a year, the effective interest rate ends up being greater than the nominal rate! This is a powerful tool for investing.</p><p></p><p>We can calculate the compound interest using the compound interest formula, which is an exponential function of the variables time t, principal P, APR r, and number of compounding periods in a year n:</p><p></p><p>A</p><p>(</p><p>t</p><p>)</p><p>=</p><p>P</p><p>(</p><p>1</p><p>+</p><p>r</p><p>n</p><p>)</p><p>n</p><p>t</p><p>For example, observe the table below, which shows the result of investing $1,000 at 10% for one year. Notice how the value of the account increases as the compounding frequency increases.</p><br />

I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist. I was attached to General MacArthur’s staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was order to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan. From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequenSeeeneral MacArthur, aided by Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation. The second I was called upon to make considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convince that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president— started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration. Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, I was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramon Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. i could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself. Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, I left for the United States.​</h2><br />

"This I Believe" by: Carlos P. Romulo
I believe above all that a man should be true to himself. I believe a man should be prepared at all times to sacrifice everything for his convictions. Twice during my life I have been called upon to make this kind of sacrifice. After Pearl Harbor, the Philippines was invaded by Japan. I had never been a soldier. I was a journalist. But something impelled me to enlist.
I was attached to General Macarthur's staff and went with him first to Bataan and later to Corregidor. In Corregidor, I was placed in charge of the broadcast called the Voice of Freedom. The Japanese reacted violently to the broadcast. I learned that a prize had been put on my head, and worse that they had gone after my wife and four sons who had been left behind in the occupied territory. I suffered indescribable torment, worrying about my loved ones. I wanted to go back to Manila at whatever cost. But I was ordered to proceed to Australia on the eve of the fall of Bataan.
From Australia, I was sent on to the United States, where I continued to make the Voice of Freedom heard, regardless of the consequences to my family. I did not see them again until after the liberation of my country by the American forces under General Macarthur, aided by the Filipino guerillas who had carried on a vigorous resistance during the more than three years of enemy occupation.
The second time was called upon to make a considerable sacrifice for my convictions was during the 1953 national elections in the Philippines. I had never been a politician, but having become convinced that I should do everything I could to help effect a change of government in my country, I resigned as Ambassador to the United States and permanent representative to the United Nations in order to enter the field against the incumbent president. I founded a third party, the Democratic Party, and accepted the nomination for president-started a vigorous campaign to awaken the Filipino people to the need for a change in administration.
Midway in the campaign, it became apparent that the two opposition parties might lose the election if they remained divided, but had an excellent chance to win if they would present a united front. I made the painful decision to withdraw my candidacy. After withdrawing my own candidacy, was the campaign manager of Mr. Ramón Magsaysay and campaigned up and down the land for him. I could not have worked harder if I had been the candidate myself.
Magsaysay won by a landslide. The temptation was strong for all those who had worked for him to share in the rewards of victory. I was convinced, however, that the first duty of everyone who had helped to bring about a change of government was to give the new president a completely free hand in making appointments to keep positions in his administration. Immediately after the elections, left for the United States.
As look back, see this pattern of action and renunciation repeated over and over again in my life-in things great and small, in war and in peace. Some may call this a credo of self-sacrifice. I prefer to describe it as being true to one's self, no matter what the cost.</h2><br />
